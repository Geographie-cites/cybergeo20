AB  - With the intention of a more rational water resources management, an idea is growing in France: rainwater harvesting and reuse for uses which are not requiring drinking water quality. Firstly developed in individual houses, such practices now appear in collective buildings projects. Nevertheless, putting into practice, this idea faces several difficulties: regulation, economic, technical, organizational, even cultural ones.

AB  - It’s a paradox that the continent where water resources and water services provision are best managed is overlooked by the global debate on privatisation. In Europe, water resources tend to escape both a privatisation and a control by a Master-State, and to become a common property of their users. Institutional differences between France and its principal neighbours are sketched, but also the common trends are indicated ; the Water Framework Directive gives the opportunity to develop them wisely in the direction of sustainable development.

AB  - This research examines the ability of a usual indicator, the density of population, to apprehend the urban structures and processes. The socio-residential organisation of the agglomeration of Hamburg (Germany) was studied using two traditional and a priori irreconcilable methods of analysis: firstly, the factor analysis which allowed the construction of a "socio-spatial aggregation" of the districts of Hamburg, and a diachronic comparison processed according to the method of Y. AHMAVAARA (1954); secondly, a study of the densities through some traditional models. Indeed, their contribution to an improvement of the comprehension of urban ecology is not very important. The approach of B. KORZYBSKI (1976), while going beyond a simple adjustment of the relation between the densities and the distance from the centre of the city, gives an additional viewpoint to the study of the densities by introducing a social dimension. Thanks to a transformation of the physical space, the author proposes to replace the effective spreading of the city, which mingles a social component and the influence of the physical setting, by a spatial arrangement having only a social content. This form of "regularization" authorizes diachronic comparisons like those carried out between cities which could be very different.

AB  - The majority of African savannas are each year traversed by fires for the benefit of hunting and agropastoral activities. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the contribution of Landsat imagery to the definition and the discretization of the zones affected by seasonal fires. The methodology used consists of three modes of treatment, namely the algorithm of detection of burned surfaces worked out by Eva and Lambin (1998), the unsupervised isodata classification realized on the thermal infra-red channel and the supervised classification by maximum likelihood carried out on optimized three-colour processes combining channels 6.1, 5 and 6.2. The treatments made it possible to highlight the areas affected by recent and old fires, the unburned forests and savannas. The method of thresholding of Lambin and Eva and the supervised classification give rather concordant results in quantitative terms as well as space covered. These two methods indicate that respective percentages of 28,25 and 27,9 of the total surface were affected by fires (old and recent). Automatic classification reduced the proportion of the territory affected by fires to 18%. This undervaluation of fires is related to the maladjustment of this last method to effectively discriminate the surfaces affected by relatively old or not very virulent fires and underlines the need for a joint use of channels 5 and 6 in the discretization of the burned surfaces. The distribution of the surface areas by type of vegetation indicates that 36% of shrub savannas, 23% of tree savannas, 7% of degraded forests and 0,4% of humid dense forests were burned at this period which corresponds just to the middle of the dry season in the study area. These experiments must however be taken again on other sites and at other periods of the year to better appreciate the contribution of the Landsat system in the study of vegetation fires in the Cameroonian territory.

AB  - At the frontier between multivariate statistics and artificial intelligence, Bayesian networks are a powerful tool to model systemic knowledge. A particularly interesting use of Bayesian networks is the search of causal links between variables in a database. In this paper, we analyse a database on urban daily mobility covering more than one hundred big world cities. Through the generating algorithms of Bayesian networks, we produced two networks derived from two different hypotheses on the causal hierarchy among the variables. Car ownership is identified as a crucial variable when considering the network resulting from the hypothesis that daily mobility determines urban structure. This network has a higher likelihood than the one resulting from the opposite hypothesis. On the other hand, the two networks converge on the importance of the offer of urban freeway and of the average speed of the road network. These two factors explain the modal split and the costs and externalities of urban transportation.

AB  - Our paper suggests that changes of the inner urban built form could be explained as a result of a process of self-organized criticality. Similar to the general behaviour of such kind of a system, urban built form grows discretely up to a point in which new additions could occur both in the boundaries and in inner areas. Once reached this critical point, the urban system stays around it, combining outer and inner growth. While outer growth is quantitative and does not modify the system’s structure, inner growth is qualitative as well as quantitative and can transform urban centrality. Replacement of old structures by new ones always occurs with extraordinary capital concentration, developing new polarization inside the urban fabric. The hypothesis is tested through the comparative evolution of different land, built form and location values within a period of continuous urban growth. Comparative indicator values are obtained by simplified simulation

AB  - While Shrinking Cities are the object of a growing interest in Europe and in the United States, they remain understudied in France. Indeed, few research works have been dedicated to the topic and urban policies, at least at the national level, do not deal with this question. This situation could find an explanation in the fact that the process of urban shrinkage, in France, has not reached the point where it could get academic and politic attention. In order to verify this hypothesis, this article aims at measuring the extent of the phenomenon of urban shrinkage in France. It will try to assess whether this process, although internationally recognized, is in France as marginal as the lack of interest it creates suggests or whether its evolution could lead to a better recognition by national policies.

AB  - Retrospective and prospective reading of the texts that found sustainable development, particularly the Brundtland report, makes it possible to recall the genesis of this concept and to analyze its theoretical bases. This reading reveals that sustainable development, such as it was conceived and diffused by UNO, contains many conceptual paradoxes which are due to a positive vision of the interrelationships between economic growth, social equity and safeguarding of the environment. However, the positive and the integrative characteristics of these relations are not always obvious. The difficult implementation of sustainable development however generates new initiatives of co-operation, like the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). It associates developed and developing countries within the framework of the Kyoto protocol whose first application phase goes from 2008 to 2012. A quantitative assessment of this mechanism at August 10, 2008, shows that 1136 projects are validated. They represent a commercial volume of 220 million tons of equivalent CO2 per annum, avoided or saved in developing countries in various activities such as energy industries and waste processing. Developed countries which take great parts in the CDM by financial and technological investments are United Kingdom (38% of the projects) and Switzerland (23% of the projects). India (31% of the projects) and China (22% of the projects) are developing countries most implied in this new mechanism. The propagation of projects illustrates the importance of economic instruments in the implementation of sustainable development at international level.

AB  - Malagasy biodiversity conservation policies have experienced a renewal since the 1990s as a result of the integration of local modes of governance in relation to access to and management of natural resources. Local contracting is expressed by the re-designation of regulated areas dedicated to biodiversity protection as conservation territories in which local knowledge and practices are recognized. The resource access governance mechanisms, put into place by the project for Transferring the Management of Renewable Natural Resources (TGRNR) designate new territories for which different groups, organized into grassroots communities (COBA), do not have the same rights of resource access, control and use. Our study examines four cases of contractualized forest management (GCF) situated in the “corridor” of the northern forested uplands: two on the western slopes in Betsileo country, and two on the eastern slope in Tanala country. These resource management transfers are recent, dating from 2003. They are examples of local environmental governance that aim to give neighboring communities, in a legitimate and representative manner, the opportunity to address the main factors contributing to resource degradation. These territorial mechanisms for biodiversity conservation interfer with existing social and territorial forms of organization, which raises questions about their appropriation in a local context. Moreover, the lack of training in the new regulatory techniques, both social and territorial, is a cause for dysfunctional management of biodiversity conservation, which hampers community-based resource management.

AB  - This paper puts forward a literary summary on the time issue in the world of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The insertion of time into spatial databases appears more and more to be the condition for their optimal historicity management. This one is directly linked to updating methods which are themselves dependent on the way in which the information was modelled in the database. Actually, if the object-oriented approach can be seen as the optimal solution to ensure a good spatio-temporal databases management, we can also say that the majority of the current suggestions are still built on the classical distinction from the (geo)relational model between spatial and thematic informations.

AB  - This article aims to provide an overview of films produced by French geographers from the beginning of the 20th century to the present. Starting from the work of Jean Brunhes at the Archives de la Planète and continuing through the pioneering experiments of the 1960s and 70s all the way to contemporary works on digital video, we briefly reconstruct the intellectual and historical contexts that gave rise to these works. We study both the geographical premises and the cinematographic practices that subtend these films. Our aim will be to understand the function these films served within the discipline of geography and to comprehend the ever increasing use of film by geographers over the course of the last century. Given the varied approaches and variegated functions of these films, we will nonetheless abstain from attempting to regroup these films under the too-rigid category of “the geographic film.” The geographers examined in this study have all had recourse to moving images, yet each has a different conception of the advantages that the audiovisual medium afforded him or her over and against the written text, which remains the standard mode of knowledge production within the discipline of geography.

En revanche, l’analyse du contenu des pixels en vue d’une modélisation statistique s’appuie sur une description thématique détaillée de points localisés très précisément.

These signs have the fundamental purpose of introducing order and sense into complex social structures. The only way in which a complex artificial world can work is to put it under the control of intelligent human behaviour. The permanence of social order and its complexity is connected with the possibility of translating them into a language accessible to individuals. But all this has a limit. There are some places in the world which cannot be described completely because they cannot be understood completely. They are places in which our bodies can just live. These places are cities. Cities are places whose increasing complexity stimulate the man to develop new languages, theories and works of art.

The reference to « neoliberalism » which appeared in France and designating a European school of thought has since then been applied to various geographic areas (West Germany, the Latin American states, the world) to qualify contrasting political practices. These successive geo-semantic shifts resulted in a polysemic, confusing and contradictory label. In these conditions, it seems necessary to try and better define the various forms of neoliberalisms that structure the political organization of territories and societies which inhabit them.

AB  - In this article, we study the turnout of the 2004 European elections. This analysis focuses on the regional level by mapping the turnout within more than 700 spatial units. Methodologically, the article uses a set of maps to present a multiscalar analysis of the turnout on the basis of three hypotheses. The first one asserts that as distance increases, voter turnout decreases. This first hypothesis expresses a geographical gradient of EU integration. Second, the hypothesis of transborder forms of vote aims to measure the role of boundaries, as barriers or as spatial discontinuities. Lastly, the third hypothesis states that sub-national differences of turnout express socio-economic disparities. The first part sums up the methodological problems in constructing the database at the regional level. The second part studies the turnout at different observation scales. In the third section, we propose a typology of regional profiles by confronting the regional turnout both to the national average and to the European average. As a conclusion, the fourth section gives a research agenda to deepen our analysis for the next elections to the European Parliament in 2009.

AB  - In the Aegean sea, in the Greek archipelago of the Dodecanese, the small island of Psérimos welcomes every day between May and October, hundreds of trippers who have come there in order to enjoy the beach and the supposed authenticity of the place. These visitors, mostly foreigners, are staying in the neighbouring islands of Kalymnos or Kos which Psérimos has become a kind of tourist hinterland. This phenomenon resulting in substantial profits, helps to keep on the spot a local population which is getting more and more involved in and sensitive to the need to preserve a good quality environment. However, the persons involved are taking part into a harsh competition which might be detrimental to the development of that very activity. Such a situation implies outside interference and decisions stating clearing the rules of the game.

AB  - Uncontrolled urbanization and the growing population pressure are essential challenges for the water management in urbanized regions of the emerging- and developing nations. In the context of a recently made research study the influence of uncontrolled urbanization regarding the groundwater recourses of the megacity Yogyakarta was explicitly analyzed. The study shows, that the groundwater replenishment has not diminished despite of the growing soil sealing which comes as a consequence of the growing urbanization. On the contrary the urban groundwater replenishment has even slightly accumulated. Admittedly the groundwater pollution rises very clearly. This is due to the effects of urban groundwater replenishment such as sewer leakages and badly constructed or actually missing sewage systems. These effects were also measured in Yogyakarta. Many inhabitants of Yogyakarta are not linked to the sewage system and conduct their sewerage through sumps and latrines directly into the subsoil. Thence the water infiltrates those aquifer located close to the surface in a little while and that often leads to a heavy contamination of the groundwater. Only 30% of the population living in the agglomeration of Yogyakarta are connected with the public water support system. Therefore many households have to cover their water demand with the help of dug wells directly from the groundwater.

AB  - Valley landscapes are a major stake in environmental management. Diagnoses are necessary in order to understand the valley landscapes at the regional scale. A morphometric approach showed the importance of the valleys (hillslopes, valley bottoms) in the structure of the regional landscape and the existence of “ordinary valleys” with banal forms. In this context, the aim of this paper is to propose a methodology to characterize their internal diversity and to assess their singularity beyond the context. Landscape metrics are calculated to quantify valley structure. There are extracted from land cover attributes obtained by remote sensing data (Spot Imagery). This quantitative approach is applied on a well-known valley by qualitative criteria.

AB  - Following works achieved by the Globalization and World Cities (GAWC), the research consortium Polynet has set out to uncover how advanced producer services which are key in Sassen’s global city theory, contribute to the making of Mega-City-Regions (MCR). This paper tests the validity and limits of MCR formation in the two cases of London/South-East England and Paris / Bassin parisien. Both quantitative data inspired by the GAWC interlocking city model and qualitative information gathered through semi-directive interviews are used. Results show the predominance of first cities (London and Paris agglomeration) but also the existence of specific trajectories between the two case studies. Notwithstanding their similar participation to the globalisation of advanced producer services, London and its region proves to be closer to the MCR formation model than its French counterpart which follows a distinct (multipolar moncentric) pattern.

AB  - What do Brasília and Jérusalem have in common besides being world capital- cities ? What unites them is the cultural amalgam and the counterposition of the weight of history – ancient, strong and present in Jérusalem and recent, weak and still "absent" in Brasília. Within this panorama, the question we are interested in discussing is why somebody, an ordinary citizen, who has the chance of choosing where to live, would decide to settle in Brasilia, of all places in Brazil, or in Jérusalem, of all places in Israel. Starting off from the principle that the residents of both cities are "citizens of the world", we put forward the hypothesis that in this decision there is a built-in will to chart the cultural history of a territory, or rather, to be an actor in charge of the multiculturalism of a territory living its day-to-day life.

AB  - This paper aims to examine the context of creation of the main concepts and methods used in the field of economics of transportation to describe and model daily mobility. It aims to understand how these concepts and methods have persisted and how they have contributed to shape the field of mobility studies. This question is rooted in an apparent paradox: a certain way of understanding and modeling daily mobility, the so called "classical method", has persisted for half a century despite drawing constant criticism. To explain this paradox, the scope of analysis must be extended to other major tools of transportation economics. For this reason I propose the concept of technical matrix, conceived as a system composed of three interconnected methodological devices. Assuming the existence of this technical matrix helps to explain the stability of the methods used to describe and model mobility, but also to understand the origin of the major concepts that structure the field of daily mobility studies.

This success, coming from the experimentation of world agencies recipes, but also from a robust internal will, amazes by the scale of the transformations which affect the country. It also raises the question of the originality and the value of the model in a regional context of underdevelopment. This article analyses the conditions of this “success story”, its spatial inscription and the limits of the model of development.

Special attention is put on the link with the perception of the built environment by households. A multivariate analysis concludes the paper. It is shown that fractal indices differ from other indicators and are very useful for characterising and understanding built landscapes, as well as for modelling and planning urban realities.

Several analysts thought they were witnessing a movement calling for the refoundation of the very concept of State, of sovereignty and of citizenship. In fact, private States, the origin of which is quite ancient, work with government structures and state images that remain very classical. However, there is a wide discrepancy among the constellation of these projects, often led by a single person.

AB  - Grand Baie, « Mauritius Saint-Tropez », is a well-known touristic destination in the Indian Ocean. Within twenty years (1970 – 1990) the little village of fishermen and agricultural workers, vacation spot of the local upper classes, became a showcase for international tourism thanks to a strong political will that counts on this sector to develop the territory. On the shown side, the seaside station flaunts the postcard view of its beautiful bay with boats, coconut trees and hotels by the sea. But on the hidden side it’s a miserable world in a revolting environment. This contrast characterizes this specific place. The anarchic settlement pushed by a flourishing touristic activity produced a chaotic urban landscape, with conflicts for area sharing, modified social relations and cultural references, and caused severe damages to the environment. The duality of the spatial organization, the ambiguous relations between local people and tourists, the sometimes irreversible damages to the environment, the political inertia bring up questions about the durability of the system.

The study is based on the exploitation of data from Landsat images from november 1990 (sensor TM) and november 2002 (ETM+ sensor). The methodology used, in addition to the digital processing of the satellite images, is based on the recognition of objects from field work and in relation with files previously put together (map of land-cover).The mapping of spaces plants’ evolution reveals a limited modification of areas that are not cultivated with on one hand greater areas of savannah tree or shrubs and areas prone to flooding, and on the other hand, a reduction of cultivated areas, temporary water and pseudo shrub -steppe. However, the interpretation of results must take into account the rainfall (1990 experienced heavier rainfall than 2002 in terms of annual rainfall), and the crucial role of pastoral mobility in the spatial dynamics of land-use.

AB  - The first provincial geographical society in France was established at Lyon in 1873 and diffused geographical knowledge by means of lectures and publications for many years. Accounts of missionary activity, exploration, colonization and foreign trade satisfied popular fascination for the exotic, and also generated potentially useful information for the city’s merchants and industrialists at the time when the French empire reached its peak. African adventures appealed to large audiences, whilst the Far East was of special interest to silk merchants and investors, and other members of the Society were keen to learn about European destinations for future holidays. Academic geographers participated in the Society but had little impact before the 1920s. Earlier attempts to realign activities with the "new geography" professed by Vidal de la Blache were not immediately successful. The Society’s lectures continued to attract audiences until the late 1960s but the Bulletin ceased to exist in 1937 and was overtaken by publications from the city’s university, notably Les Études rhodaniennes later known as the Revue de géographie de Lyon, and subsequently Géocarrefour. Geography was no longer a topic of widespread popular interest having become a more emphatically academic concern.

AB  - Studies on urban spaces require detailed information with a high quality. This has a cost that limits its availability in the less developed countries and makes researchers dependent on existing resources. Whatever the considered problem, the question of sources is essential. With the development and democratization of GIS and satellite imagery, a large number of information from increasingly diversified sources becomes available. The civilian satellites to Earth observation flying over the planet for the years 1960-70, enable the detection and mapping of different ecosystems. In this study, we plan to explore the Dakar metropolitan area. Big African metropolis Dakar has a good-quality census coverage, which has recently been spatialized. We also have recent satellite images complementing this equipment. If a study on the crossing of census data with satellite information is not a very original approach, its application to the metropolitan Dakar will investigate specifically the sub-space urban areas of the city. Interest will therefore to establish links between social attributes (by census data), landscapes in these areas, and their occupation of the land (environmental variables extracted from satellite imagery). These preliminary results, presented here, will be the cornerstone of a study of urban malaria, which questions the interactions between the space of the vector, Anopheles, and that of the host, the human being. However, the spatial distribution of the vector is closely related to socio-economic attributes of populations. In other words, we wish initially to assess the relevance of these two sources in order to approach the wealth inequalities of the population of Dakar. This concept is defined synthetically by the lack of material resources of the inhabitants, which places them in a precarious and unstable situation when they are subjected to an external threat (eg floods, diseases, ...) This work will also inform the geography of the city of Dakar, at a fine scale or even very fine.

AB  - The expression spatial analysis covers two complementary activities : exploratory spatial analysis, paradigmatically examplified by chorematics, consists in questioning mysterious data for their meaning, while constitutive spatial analysis, apparently more passive, yet highly active in cartographic generalization, consists in accepting data in their given spatial configuration. Either analysis is productive in as much as geographers and cartographers, when reasoning on data, do not see them as such, i.e. as isolated, closed figures or objects, but as evocative, thought provoking manifestations of the geographical phenomena they stand for. By contrast, this explains why their automation happens to be problematic:digital data mean nothing to the computer and their paucity (traces instead of shapes, lists instead of pictures) further estranges the expected reality they stand for from the user's grasp or perception. Yet thegeographical potency of digital data, if not storable explicitly in the computer, is retrieved through the efforts and applications of the GIS researcher, whose attitude is described in this text under the name of phenomenology.

AB  - This work focuses on the relationship between the cold environments and the pulmonary consultation in Sfax over the period 1995-2005. The winter cold environments are expressed by the index of Thom bioclimatic discomfort and the wind chill used in seasonal, monthly and daily scale. The increase of pulmonary consultation is due to winter cold environments. The winter types of meteorological situations have an important impact on the biometeorological environment and, consequently, on number of pulmonary consultations registered daily.

AB  - Even though, at the national level, increases in GDP are an important development objective, the survival of local communities is often ensured by the capacity to maintain or generate employment. An important body of work has examined local particularities and the connection between territory and development – particularly employment creation. Another body of work seeks to understand the general processes governing the geographic distribution of employment growth. Starting from an approach developed in the Canadian context, two questions can be raised: 1) to what extent can an approach conceived in order to understand the geography of employment growth in Canada be relevant in a French context? 2) what are the factors governing the geography of development in France between 1982 and 2006? We show that, although the North-American approach captures the geographic dimensions of French development rather well, the underlying logic of French development is different. This paradox highlights the need to develop theory at an intermediate (meso) level, situated somewhere between the particularistic territorial approach and the universalist economic one, which would be able to capture contextual effects.

AB  - The word belt has appeared in 1911 in the French geography of the United States as taught as school. The corn, wheat or cotton belt don’t exist anymore on the American ground but the notion of belt is still important for those who teach American geography in the French high schools. We will go over the history of belts in the French geography at school to demonstrate that they last the beginning of the XXIst century out because geography at school is a generalizing discipline that uses models and because a few French geographers only have been acting as links between academic geography of the United States and geography at school.

AB  - <r2r:ml lang="ru"><p class="resumeru" dir="ltr">The rural dynamics of the Ecuadorian Sierra are the result of the three-fold influence of demographic pressure, modes of land occupation and migration. The Bolívar province, situated on the outer slopes of the western Cordillera is of particular importance as it is a key territory in regional migration. Demographic growth, which is in fact fairly high, gives rise to a fairly low rate of population increase locally but a very high level of emigration towards the lowlands of the pediment, towards the country's major cities, Quito and Guayaquil, and also into Amazonia. When we add to this the two models of spatial organisation among the <em>mestizos</em> and the <em>campesinos</em>, we can clearly see the source of the conflict that is shaking the Sierra, namely, who should cultivate and who should control. <br />The study is based on three levels of analysis. First we look at the relationship between the Bolívar province and the rest of the country. Secondly, we analyse at regional level and using different chorotypes. Lastly, we focus on a small valley, examining the unequal distribution of land and the diversity of resources which give rise to three distinct socio-spatial systems : <em>hacienda</em>, <em>mestizos</em> and <em>campesinos</em> which are represented in a hillside model. </p></r2r:ml>

AB  - Streams networks are part of transport networks and more generally of “spatial networks” that gave rise to fundamental researchs (Barthelemy, 2011) and applied geography (Strano et al., 2012). Numerous studies have focused on fractal analysis of stream networks. However, only few papers compare or discuss the estimation methods and the uncertainty of the main fractal indicator, the fractal dimension. This work focuses on the fractal properties of vector networks both virtual and actual. We first mention the essential distinction between infinite mathematical fractal and nature fractal. Then, we present different theoretical and empirical dimensions that we use. In particular, we compare three fractal dimension estimators: the most classical estimator for stream networks, based on a topological approach with the Horton-Strahler ratios, and two other estimators based on a geometric approach, the box-counting dimension and the correlation dimension. Three main methodological results can be highlighted: 1- the study of virtual network contributes to the assessment of the various estimators relevance, according to the characteristics of networks; 2- an empirical fractal domain must be determined with an objective method to estimate fractal dimensions that can be compared; 3- the observation of uncertainty and stability of the fractal dimension is necessary for any valid comparison.

AB  - The economic choices in Honduras have an influence on Choluteca, a city wedged between the Salvadorian and Nicaraguan borders. The dynamics which characterize Choluteca can be explained by the involvement of urban actors who have played off the local environment (mangrove, spacious plains, climatic conditions), national legislation (the prohibition of foreigners settling within forty kilometres of the terrestrial and maritime borders) and the markets of rich countries to carry out development of the countryside, transforming it into an agro-export enclave (shrimp, melons). The agricultural sector is thus the motor of urban development. Its repercussions are especially felt in Choluteca, a city classified as “rural”, with the reactivation of the Panamerican road, which is the backbone of access to distant (mainly American) markets, situating the city within the economic practices of the world system. The populations of the countryside, just like the urban populations of the rest of the country, are attracted by the possibilities offered by Choluteca. Thus, in Choluteca one can find “rural urban fieldworkers”, members of the traditional elite, and highly specialized technicians who have come to work in the agro-industrial enclave. This analysis highlights how and to what extent the practices of these urban operators arrange the spaces of the region of Choluteca and profoundly modify the city, except the power.

AB  - An attempt is made to identify the dynamics of urban systems during the historical process of their evolution. An illustration is made with the case of European cities between 1200 and 1990, using harmonised historical data bases. Simple maps show first a general expansion in cities number and size over time, reflecting the ability of the system to continuously adapt its structure over time. A second trend is an increased hierarchisation in city size, which may be related to the continuous improvement in the speed and capacity of transportation means. Because of this space-time contraction, large cities short-circuit small towns, and inequalities in city size are widening. A third trend leading to a spatial reorganisation, emerges from maps of the urban population potentials. Among all possible mathematical equations and parameters values which could describe the intensity and the spatial range of interactions between cities, we choose those which give rather stable results and which are compatible with the analysis of urban historians, as De Vries, Braudel, Bairoch, Hohenberg and Lees, for the centuries preceding industrial revolution, by using evaluations of distances in terms of time and cost. Urban systems dynamics is better approached with reference to this relative space than on usual topographic maps.

AB  - Throughout Europe products of Jewish culture – or what is perceived as such – have become viable components of the popular public domain. Jewish-themed tourism has emerged since the 1990s in a number of European cities after decades of “collective amnesia”, and some of the Jewish areas have recently undergone a ‘Jewish-thematisation’. The focal point of this article is the usage of heritage in former Jewish areas. The aim is to understand in which ways and to what extent Jewish heritage is used for tourism purposes. A comparison between Krakow and Vilnius underlines what this difference in usage depends on, in the context of increasingly popular cultural and heritage tourism. In order to understand how Jewish-themed tourism has developed an inventory of Jewish heritage and Jewish-themed events in the two cities is made, showing that Jewish heritage is mainly used for economic development through tourism as well as commemoration in Krakow, whereas in Vilnius, it is used for commemoration and for the needs of the local (Jewish) community. The complexity of the topic and the importance of various local factors in the usage of Jewish heritage are shown. There does not exist, neither in Krakow nor in Vilnius, any specific public policies regarding Jewish heritage that can explain the ’degree’ of touristification and ’heritagisation’ of the areas. Furthermore, a range of connected theoretical issues, such as authenticity, commodification of culture, or ownership of heritage, is raised.

Celebration was designed according to the standards of the neotraditional town-planning movement and thus reproduces the Main Street section of the theme parks. Its attempt to function as a refuge-city is suggested through references to an idealized past. This article aims to show the influences used during the design stage and the promotion of the city, aswell as the reactions it sparked in the American press : Celebration was infact presented to the public as a prime alternative to decaying fifties suburbs of the Sun Belt, a utopia for the nineteen-nineties.

Simulations showed that the modification of three variables (built areas density, Euclidean distance from each cell to road network and network distance to urban center) is sufficient to make different typical patterns emerge, and that these patterns correspond to different ways to organize urban space. This method improves understanding of the role of proximities in urban dynamics, in order to build models based on spatial and topological properties to describe evolution of urban systems.

AB  - This paper proposes an exploratory study on a representation of countries sorted by socio-spatial complexes of risks within HIV. Using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) on a set of socio-geographic, socio-economic variables with epidemiological features presents one way to synthesis infection structures. Used data are part of selective statistical results on 44 sub-Saharan countries that have been recently published. Both socio-geographic and economic components associated in Adult 15-49 years old population groups interfere in complex combinations varying from a place to an other. The set of insular (Comoros, Madagascar) and Atlantic countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea) with low rate of infection (< 3 %) point out low exposure states. The southern set of rich countries (South Africa, Namibia, Swaziland, Botswana) with infection rates exceeding 12 % indicate high exposure conditions. Between these two extreme states, others diversified exposure situations can be differentiated and mapped. Sets of high endemic conditions, epidemic rise and deep epidemic occurred respectively in the East, in the West and in the Center of Africa.

AB  - The administrative territory of Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam, was redrawn in 2008 with the annexing of the neighbouring province of Ha Tay. The territorial restructuring of this Southeast Asian capital city–with an enviable economic dynamism– results of a strong political gesture. Yet it also hides an entanglement of land-related political and economic interests and conflicts. Indeed, since the economic opening of Vietnam in the mid-1980s, land played a crucial role in the creation of new private wealth across certain social strata. This article explores the role of territorial policies aimed at attracting private investments and of strategies elaborated by public and private urban development actors to access developable lands and assess their impact on the decision to extend Hanoi’s administrative perimeter. We show how new land strategies and territorial governance practices motivated the central power to bring Ha Tay back into the fold of its authority. We also emphasize on the way how pressures put on land at the edge of Hanoi compromised the harmonious development of the national capital and led to its extension.

The spaces they were allocated were designed for those purposes. Nevertheless, new social forms and an original and dynamic urban culture are today thriving in the same spaces. This paper shows how family structures, internal organisation of houses, and the networks of associations achieved these transformations. The analysis of mental maps also confirms the fact that space in Black neighbourhoods is most significantly a projection of social relations and networks.

Intensity, duration and kind of initiated interim uses have different extensive effects on the local hydrologic situation. The article in hand aims to bringing together findings from the special fields of hydrology and city/ landscape morphology. In the first chapter, the impacts of urbanization on groundwater and the specific role of abandoned sites in this research context will be shortly described. The second part will give an overview of ‘typical’ abandoned sites and situations within a mega-urban context on the basis of different examined urban units. The present study should carry out the interdependencies between self regulation mechanisms (in terms of interim uses) and their effects on the water resources as well as the underlying dynamic processes. The discussion at the end transfers the findings from microscale to the mega-urban context and thus allows conclusions about the overall urban development and the resulting vulnerability of megacity Guangzhou.

Cost distances are more and more used, in order to measure a realistic distance, by means of resistance values given for each landscape types. Here, we propose a method to compute resistance values by using ‘topological functions of landscape’, i. e. by taking account of proximity to habitat/ non habitat edges. We used a data set concerning the spreading of the fossorial water vole outbreak in the Franche-Comté region, and we tested several functions. The results show that statistical correlations clearly increase in comparison with usual cost-distances.

AB  - Local personnel numbers focus attention when there are strong constraints on public budgets. Using financial data for local governments in Ile-de-France, the weight and the share of public expenditure in personnel spending are evaluated. Communities’ expenditures for their employees exceed the amount of local taxes. The share of expenditure in the operating budgets reached on average 36% in 2000, 41% in 2010. As a consequence, the financial rigidity increases. Local contrasts in personnel costs are strong. For instance charges increase with population and stabilize for the most important localities. Given the diversity, restrictive measures should take different paths according to local contexts. The expenditures of the various levels of government are added together. The share of departments is closed to the share of communities. Reductions in personnel spending need joint actions of these two levels. But political rivalries and questions about governance suggest that outcomes are rather uncertain.

Which resources have to be preserved for the generations to come, if today we do not know which will be essential? Sustainability makes the dead end on the fact that the history of humanity is an alternation of more or less stationary phases and brutal ruptures. Can we really connect global and local scales in a large machinery, as if same principles governed the whole world and each single place?. Actually, sustainable development dreams an unrealistic smooth world without clashes, conflicts, crises.

AB  - The geographer and anarchist Elisée Reclus is considered as one of the foremost anti colonialists of his time. When analyzing his writings, several authors were unable to ignore the fact that even when he criticized colonization methods, Reclus was nevertheless an advocate of colonization. This paper attempts to review the issue by using archive material and publications and by looking once more at Elisée Reclus’s stance in the second half of the 19th century, together with other critics of colonial events from other political backgrounds. In spite of his criticism and humanism, it is clearly documented that throughout his life, Reclus was a dedicated partisan of colonization, even if his view was a “democratic” and somewhat idealized version. Reclus’s position appears logical when related to commonly held western beliefs, shared by the radical left socialists and anarchists, that the “civilized world” had a mission to fulfill in the rest of the world. The colonial issue can be seen as a major component of the on-going globalization, already at work for many centuries.

AB  - Photographic samplings representative of a space and recorded in an image databases now give us access to a new set of information on the landscape (landscape architecture, atmosphere, colours...). The presented example is based on a survey that allows us to characterise landscapes in an objective manner, as seen from two different projected itineraries heading towards Santiago de Compostela from Franche-Comté. The point was to put ourselves in the position of future users by taking pictures of the landscape as it will be displayed. and thus viewed by the person walking towards Santiago. It also is to apprehend landscape variations that give a pace to the walk, making it pleasant or tedious. A typology of the encountered landscapes is being produced based on an analysis of the pictures, processed three at a time. Image banks and GIS tools then allow us to visualise landscapes as they are perceived all along the paths. A representation by histogram does facilitates the visual distinction of different types and make easier to assess landscape variations or "rhythms". The fact of taking into account the perception processes of the users of a space shows how landscape will appear strongly diversified – in a linear approach – by the rhythms of the walk. This way we can link space, mobility and temporality.

AB  - The word reconnaissance often means exploration in exploration’s narrative. At a a hinge time, the 1900s, the paper aims to show that, instead of reducing the meaning of reconnaissance to its explorative side, it could be fruitful to consider this term’s polysemy and to question the link between reconnnaître and connaître. The corpus studied here is the french geographical review, the Annales de Géographie, where exploration’s narrative is well present even if it’s not a specialized review. Our hypothesis is that the reconnaissance’s moment should be taken very seriously in the shaping of geographical knowledge : the reconnaissance is a time for testing hypothesis and confronting conjectures to geographical reality. The first part of the paper develops a general analysis, while the second one offers a case study on Antarctica, the last big white patch on the globe around 1900.

AB  - The term 'temporal' in spatial analysis has a number of potential meanings, each of which requires an alternative approach for the provision of analytic support. Much present work in spatio-temporal information is concerned with transaction versioning. Object based representations often demand a high level of initial understanding of object relationships. Many GIS users are seeking to understand the object relationships over time, past, present and future ; their research focus is how real-world features interact in time and space. Despite this requirement, little present work will support this requirement to understand the drivers of change, rather than simply to report what changed. A number of workers have / are attempting to formalise a theory of spatio-temporal reasoning (eg Hermosilla, 1994, Qian, et al, 1997, Claramunt et al, 1997), in the most part working from a theoretical abstraction. Worboys, 1998, uses a problem oriented approach, as does Halls and Miller (1995, 1996). Representation of change over time by means of spline curves offers possibilities for this type of work, Neural Networks are explored as an implementation solution. We show that the AURA neural network architecture offers particular hope and that the proposals of Yeh & de Cambray and Halls & Miller need to be recast in terms of the AURA architecture.

AB  - The question of complexity and its increasing application to social sciences is challenging the modelling of spatial systems. New concepts and new methods have been proposed and invite to reformulate classical modelling frames. This approach is demanding to open a better informed dialogue between the disciplines which supply models and tools and those where the existing knowledge is reformulated inside this new frame. Actually, creating an « artificial geography » is not straightforward. It is rather easy to translate urban theories within the paradigm of complex systems, but their modelling, for instance by using multi-agents systems, still raises many conceptual and practical difficulties. We underline here some problems in defining significant urban entities and exploring the evolution of their spatial relationships over time. We briefly present which options have been selected for developing the SIMPOP2 model which is conceived for simulating the evolution of systems of cities over long periods of time.

AB  - The objectives of sustainable development in urban policies - beyond its heterogeneity – lead to negotiations between local levels of government and the operators of economic sectors involved in the organization of cities. In river cities, a negotiation is taking place between the different urban governments (municipal and inter-municipal levels) and the inland waterway managers and the port authorities. This negotiation seems to open a new chapter in the history of the relationship city / river by introducing reflections on reconnection. Two aspects of this reconnection are currently explored through various planning instruments: bringing industrial and port wasteland back into urban use (since the 1980s and 1990s) and considering the utility of ports with regard to sustainable development (since the beginning of the years 2000). The attempt to reconnect the city to the port and the port to the city may constitute a spatial issue. This reconnection, surrounded by conflicts, contributes to the evolution of urban morphology. The example of the French cities of Lyon and Strasbourg provides an illustration of this point.

AB  - This paper focuses on the concept of asustainable city and its theoretical implications for the urban system. Urban sustainability is based on positive interactions among three different urban sub-systems : social, economic and physical, where social well-being coexists with economic development and environmental quality. This utopian scenario doesn’t appear. Affluent economy is often associated with poverty and criminality, labour variety and urban efficiency coexist with pollution and congestion. The research subject is the analysis of local risk and opportunity conditions, based on the application of a special definition of risk elaborated and made operative with the production of a set of maps representing the multidimensional facets of spatial organisation in urban sustainability. The interactions among the economic/social and environmental systems are complex and unpredictable and present the opportunity for a new methodology of scientific investigation : the connectionistic approach, processed by Self-Reflexive Neural Networks (SRNN). These Networks are a useful instrument of investigation and analogic questioning of the Data Base. Once the SRNN has learned the structure of the weights from the DB, by querying the network with the maximization or minimization of specific groups of attributes, it is possible to read the related properties and to rank the areas. The survey scale assumed by the research is purposefully aimed at the micro-scale and concerns the Municipality of Milan which is spatially divided into 144 zones.

AB  - The implementation of garment industries builds original periurban spaces in Phnom Penh. The development of this activity accelerates the urban growth and introduces some new socio-economic connections between the city and its peripheral spaces. The discourses, practices and representations of the workers reveal the existence of a homogenous social group. Their new urban life is mainly structured by the habitat and the secondary street. However, those particular urban spaces are transformed by the conquest of periurban spaces by a new class of urban entrepreneurs. In this article, we would like to show how the industrialization in Phnom Penh transforms the processes of urban sprawl, and how the urban sprawl affects the socio-spatial realities of the workers.

AB  - In this paper, we outline how we have developed a series of technologies to enable detailed interactive 3-D Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based models of cities to be created. Until relatively recently these models have been developed in Computer Aided Design (CAD) software more often then in GIS. One of the main reasons was that ‘3-D GIS’ was often only 2.5-D under closer inspection. This is changing, and by straddling both technologies, and integrating others, we show how these models in turn enable planning information, statistics, pollution levels, sea level rises and much more to be visualised and analysed in the context of the 3-D city model. The client for ‘Virtual London’ is the Greater London Authority (GLA) and their aim is to develop improved dissemination of planning information, which is explored. We then argue that virtual cities should go well beyond the traditional conceptions of 3-D GIS and CAD into virtual worlds and online design. But we also urge caution in pushing the digital message too far, showing how more conventional tangible media is always necessary in rooting such models in more realistic and familiar representations.

AB  - Languedoc-Roussillon is a region of France where rural and urban areas have historical links based on wine economy. In recent years, this Mediterranean region has seen major urban transformations, affecting land use in a rapid manner, mostly in terms of farming land. These changes are characterized by the increasing urban contiguity in coastal areas, urban sprawl and dynamics of metropolitan characteristics between the cities of Montpellier and Nîmes. We propose a methodology to learn more in depth these current urban dynamics, and especially the spatial relationships and structures resulting there from. The above said methodology therefore includes analysis and modelling of spatial changes at regional scale. The results are sorted in a typology of urban dynamics. This typology is crossed with the spatial analysis of the transformations of land use, especially in areas where the mutations of agricultural, forest and artificial soils are most important. This crossed analysis between urbanisation and mutations of farming land aims at contributing to an integrated and systemic geographical knowledge of the changes in land use at regional scale. These results could be of use in supporting a prospective reflection for territorial policies intending to meet the challenges of the changes in land use in areas with high urban pressure, where the place of agriculture in territorial development is now questioned.

The role of the marginal areas remaining the source of a continuous raw material supply to the main manufacturing centres is crucial.

At least, our study aims to help hydraulic modelling by evaluation of  water heights and volumes. The method presented in this paper is composed of three main stages: 1) flood cartography from RADAR images and extraction of informative limits, 2) water levels evaluation in flood plain by matching informative limits with topographic data, 3) decrease of water levels estimation uncertainties by introduction of hydraulic coherence concept.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to better understand the geography of risk associated with French nuclear power plants. In this context, we look for the determinants of the social acceptance of risk according to geographical area. Concretely, we proceed in two steps : we first identify factors explaining the willingness to live in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant. Then we test whether the location choices are associated with differentiated perceptions of nuclear risk. The first model confirms the psycho-sociological approach of risk and highlights a positive link between the acceptance of nuclear risk and proximity of the residence to a nuclear plant : the NIMBY effect (Not In My Back Yard) is not found at the local level. The second model confirms the existence of a location bias that we interpret as a “neighborhood halo effect”.

AB  - In the areas with a dairy production and in a hedgerow landscape surrounding, the farms appear as the elementary units of the structuration of rural spaces and landscape. The study of the logics of organization of the farmers’ practices thus appears as a pertinent grid to analyse the dynamics of the transformations of agricultural spaces and landscapes. For the dairy farms of the Western Atlantic Europe, the factors linked to the morphology of the fields play a dominating part (plots pulverization, acreage of the farm). From this angle, the analysis of the part played by the distance of the fields from the farm buildings itself as far as the organization of the farmers’ practices is concerned, takes on a central place. How can we take this distance into account and measure it too? The methods coming from the development of the Geographical Information Systems bring along, in this field, interesting advances. Making a grid based on distance criteria to read farmers’ practices highlights the diversity of land use organization of dairy farms in various agricultural and spatial contexts (Galicia, Normandy and England). This diversity then sends back to the dynamics of changes of agricultural systems relating to the land concentration (increase of the farms’ size, land consolidation), relating to the production system (specialization, intensification) and relating to the farms functioning (mechanization, automation, development of cooperative societies).

AB  - The reason why it is so difficult to build some operational framework to sustainable development lies in the fact that sustainable development never happens out of the blue. This paper tries to figure out how such a framework can be imagined from three criteria: the type of governance, the type of sustainability and definition of the resources. It supposes abandoning the unique and universal sustainable development’s myth, and to replace it by plural sustainable developments. European Union is a good target to focus on in order to define those sustainable developments, since the EU proposes an European strategy for sustainable development that European countries, regions or local governments convert into heterogeneous policies.

AB  - Interaction models and especially potential model have often been used for demographic or social purposes, in order to study the relationships dimension between population types and locations or between users and goods etc. Defining the interactions between space characteristics, Donnay (1997, 1995, 1994) and Binard (1995) have promoted the application of such model on remote sensing products in order to obtain urban delimitation. Another use of potential model also dealing with remotely sensed product has been proposed by Weber et al. (1997  ; Weber, 1998) by the integration of potential model principles and GIS capacities to evaluate development trends of an urban settlement over years. In this case GIS is used to diversify the importance of locations taken into account over the studied area. This could be defined by spatial information (as initial input) and other characteristics attached : urban regulation, environment protection laws, urban development trends etc. This allows multiplying the current visions of urban area development. Referring to natural constrains or anthropic decisions such approach offers the possibility to integrate different types of interactions between various locations. Statistical methods are applied to get land-cover classification results of the images used, then potential model is processed in order to obtain potential surfaces associated with specific spatial characteristics. The resulting layers might be combined to get composed information on the area or ordered results. The application presented has been conducted on the Strasbourg region in order to assess the method according the city development reality. A time analysis has been set up linked to spatial changes evaluation. Dynamic processes have been identified through sequential estates (1986 – 1998). The potential model application is used to get a more predictive idea of the spatial changes reality, allocating diverse weights to landscape locations. Two satellite images have been used : the first one to get a first idea of the land-cover surface on Strasbourg and the surroundings (SPOT XS 1986), and the second one has been processed (1) to perform time series analysis and (2) to assess the accuracy of the potential model application (SPOT XS 1998). Ancillary data are gathered in order to enrich our knowledge on the studied area through environmental, planning or demographic points of view. The expected results are the identification of development trends from potential model application on remotely sensed results. Point to be stressed is the determination of the location weights according to spatial characteristics. Methods considered to deal with the combination of weights are close to multicriteria analysis.

AB  - This research aims at taking into account the mutations of the various zonings that are used to collect statistical data. The focus is on the conception of a model that handles the mutations of units that are composing those zonings, based on the building of the units’ genealogy. An automation of the update process of such a model is highly desirable, integrating the zoning versions as they come. The identity of each unit and its life are at the core of the model, which uses events to index changes of those units. The update process uses an algorithm which detects events based on geometrical constraints, and units are matched by means of a belief function that combines the various criteria defining the identity of a unit through out time. The expert can use a dedicated interface in order to control and analyse the results, and integrate its own knowledge on the history of the considered territories.

In this study, the edge detection technique and the mathematical morphology are joined to the multiresoltion technique to reach the targeted goal. The obtained results on the reduced images are then extrapolated in order to obtain the coastline length on the original image. The presented methodology allows getting good estimations of coastline lengths from great size satellite images, and it is particularly useful to the follow-up of the coast erosion process.

AB  - The study of urban and peri-urban change represents a major challenge for local authorities, especially in areas at risk (ex. flood) and representing an ecological potential. The Bruche lower valley (Bas-Rhin, France) is increasingly urbanized under pressure from Strasbourg. The monitoring of settlement process was achieved over a period of 20 years to identify the phases of urbanization and their consequences. The multi-temporal remote sensing images of Spot acquired in 1986, 1996 and 2005 and "Spatial metric" were jointly used to identify the main forms of evolution of land-cover during this period and to characterize the landscape changes. The results highlight a trend of increasing density and sprawl process in the valley accompanied by a significant change of the landscape structure. The paper is structured in four sections. First, related works on monitoring of land-use/cover are exposed. Second, image processing are presented and the application of various landscape metrics. Third, the description of results is detailed. Finally, conclusion and perspective approaches are discussed.

The “second-order” adaptation concept encompasses those adjustments that result from individual household decision instead of planned action by government’s decision. However, New Orleans is still reluctant to admit the benefits that could result from the shrinkage of its territorial footprint.

AB  - The subject of this study is the interrelationship between household formation and changes in the housing market. Young people's possibilities to move from their parental home are especially focused upon. These possibilities are dependent upon a number of processes in the housing market, such as production of new dwellings or the actions of other households. This means in turn that the situation of young people is treated as a part of a much larger and complex system of interaction in a local housing market. The primary thesis of the study is that interaction between individuals and structure is of crucial importance. The development of a method to describe complex interactions is an important part of the study. In order to describe many simultaneous processes on the individual level, in time and space, a micro-simulation model has been constructed. The model provides a good picture of the moves of young people and how their possibilities are restricted by both their own situation and structural conditions.

AB  - For many countries, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are the main estimates of HIV prevalence at national level in general population. Several DHS collect longitude and latitude of surveyed clusters. In this paper, we present three methodological approaches for mapping spatial variations of HIV prevalence from DHS. These approaches are applied to DHS simulation sampled from a model country. The estimated surfaces are then compared with the initial surface of the model. We show that a method using kernel estimators with adaptive bandwidths of the same number of observed people allows estimating main regional trends of the epidemics. Its application to data from 2003 DHS of Burkina Faso give a plausible picture of the epidemiological situation in this country.

AB  - Transhumance in the Sahel have been described and mapped extensively because they represent an essential pillar for securing pastoral systems. However, very few quantifiable indicators exit to guide decision makers and policy makers for taking transhumance into account. Through a case study in the Senegalese Ferlo we propose novel indicators (spatial and not) to analyse and monitor pastoral territories as defined by the long transhumance of Ferlo’s pastoralists. We propose two indicators, computed from recorded itineraries followed by pastoralists and herds, which show the intensity of transhumance in space and time (transhumant.day.km-2), during the journey and at destination. Crossing these indicators with rainfall data indicate that transhumance is more structural and strategic than opportunistic, while somehow climate-dependant with partial correlation with total yearly rainfall. Through origin-destination matrices that summarize fluxes between departure areas (“home zones”) and destination zones (“foster zones”), we build two other indicators that are aggregated at administrative levels, i.e. the emissivity index which shows the fraction of herders that initiate transhumance from a given residency zone, and the attractivity index which shows the fraction of herders that end-up in a given foster zone. A complementary indicator shows the connectedness of these zones through transhumance, and therefore is useful for highlighting the set of zones where coordination of pastoral policies would be desirable. All these indicators based on pastoral mobility also help grasping dimensions of local interactions (such as access to resources and opportunities for trade) and regional interactions (territorial supply and demand).

AB  - For a few years now, several development projects have been carried out in municipal contexts in order to make spatial information available on the Internet. An overall observation of the existing municipal Web sites obviously shows the great variety of the objectives at stake, and of the technological solutions implemented. Despite the increasing number of researches dealing with the democratization of e-information addressed to citizens and e-governments, it is still difficult to clearly identify the current privileged means of communication between cities and citizens on the basis of cartographic data. This difficulty is related to the absence of formal and effective frameworks to characterize and classify the various ways to diffuse geospatial information on municipal Web sites. On the basis of the above, the present research aims at remedying this ignorance by elaborating a new classification framework to effectively describe GIS-based Web sites in municipal contexts. The adopted strategy consists in analysing the already existing partial approaches of classification, in order to pursue with the development of a more comprehensive pragmatic classification framework. This framework is then the subject of an experimentation consisting of a detailed analysis of the contents and functioning of a hundred existing municipal Web sites in Canada. Finally, this experimentation makes it possible to draw initial conclusions regarding the usability of the new classification mode proposed, as well as to identify some further research pathways.

AB  - On november 3rd, 1997, a conference was held in Paris devoted to a review of the activities of "section 39 : Space, Territories and Societies", a CNRS commission in which most French human geographers, along with some architecte, urbanists and sociologists are found. The presentation of the research field "Geography and Culture" led to a strong discussion between the two reviewers in charge of the presentation and later with both of them and the public. This paper was written in reaction to this discussion. It is here argued that it is time for French geographers to stop focusing on methodological issues, for the situation is far more complex than just an opposition between deductive quantitative and nomothetic geography on the one side, and empirical, qualitative and idiographic geography on the other side. In fact, a deductive approach can rely on qualitative data only, and an empirical approach can lead to some theoretical developments. But one cannot deny that there is an urgent need for empirical geography to formalise its methodology. Also, in reaction to Professor Anne Buttimer´s remarks who, invited to react as a foreign expert, underlined that French cultural geography gives most of its attention to heritage and historical issues, some explanations to this situation are developed.

AB  - The aim of this study is to test the Spot 5 satellite imagery for the cartography of terrestrial vegetation in the prospect of a monitoring of coastal zones. Two methods are used. The first method is based on a photointerpretation of a 2.5 meters multipectral image with the european EUNIS habitat classification. A comparison with aerial orthoimages is realised. The results show that Spot 5 satellite imagery is quite suitable for the vegetation mapping at a local scale. The majority of the habitats are identified with very few exceptions (patchy habitat of particular texture and of small size). The second method is based on the updating of existing data by the classification of the 10 meters multispectral image into a GIS. This process implies the development of a vegetation dynamic model. A map is produced in a short delay. It may be useful for the large-scale monitoring of dynamic vegetation processes.

This apparent paradox is considered with reference to geocomputation. The unknown quality of the data generates apprehension amongst potential users. Respondents to a lifestyles survey are self-selecting, creating bias in the dataset. Young adults are identified as least likely to return a survey and pensioners more likely. The level of population coverage achieved by the survey varies geographically. Hence, whilst lifestyles offer rich sources of micro-level data to cross-validate or supplement Census-based analysis, greater scientific credential remains as a pre-cursor to academic acceptance.

AB  - In order to identify areas where desertification may have occurred over the last two decades, 109 stations located in three bioclimatic zones of Niger are analyzed. Time series of remote sensing data are well suited to this task. Here, we use time series of NOAA AVHRR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and rainfall data. In this study, trend analysis is used to identify areas within the biomes from 1981 to 1999 in Niger with apparent land degradation in semi-arid areas. It appears that most of Niger (98%) recorded increasing rainfall while only 76% experienced increasing maximum NDVI. However, the combination of the two variables through the ratio shows a widespread reduction of the rain-use efficiency with non significant trend for the stations located in northern Sahel (p=0.52), highly significant for those located in central Sahel (p=0.00009) and significant in southern Sahel (p=0.041). Overall, 75.3% of the sample recorded a significant reduction of the NDVIMax/RR ratio. Only one station out of four (24.7%) presented a stability of the ratio. These negative trends suggest a progressive diminution of the vegetation productivity as highlighted by the lowering of the NDVIMax/RR ratio. This situation suggest a consistently environmental degradation and that desertification processes continued during the last two decades over most of the Sahelian belt of Niger.

AB  - This paper is based on the analysis of hourly tide measurements at four tide gauges stations around the Gulf of Lions: Marseille, Grau-de-la-Dent, Sète and Port-Vendres. For each tidal value, surge heights have been determined to keep only the atmospheric forcing on the level of the Sea. The aim is to improve our understanding of surge related-coastal-risks by analysing the relationship between strong surges and their atmospheric forcing factors at different spatial scale. Sea-surges vriations around the Gulf of Lions are spatially consistent at different time scales. Hourly and daily maximum surges are strongly correlated between the four stations. Around the Gulf of Lions, sea surge are regionally associated with a southerly wind tending to drag the water towards the coasts. Although regional surges results from a combination of air pressure pattern and its regional associated wind over an extended area, local surges peaks are often reached when the local wind direction favours water accumulation on that particular coastal area. That’s why each station has its sea-surge preferential southerly wind directions. But according to the local coastal orientation, strong surges at Port-Vendres and Marseille can be even forced by a local northerly wind enable to favour the water accumulation too. Taken into account various spatial scaleis here crucial to improve our understanding of coastal risks associated with sea surges around the Gulf of Lions.

AB  - Coastal habitats have been deeply impacted and fragmented by human activities. In Europe, such habitats also benefit from rich and diverse historical archives (maps and writings) that allow accurate assessment of their spatial dynamics and the way they have been exploited by humans. Through the example of the saltmarshes of the Anse de l’Aiguillon, among the largest in France, we assessed the spatial dynamics of these habitats as well as their exploitation by local societies during the last three centuries. We found that if they are expanding for the last decades, land-reclamations led to a massive reduction of their surface areasfrom 1705 to the 1970s. Moreover, if they were drained and mowed for a long time, these activities are more developed nowadays than in the 1950s. We finally revealed writings and archeological remains attesting for a salt-marsh hay storage and exportation since the beginning of the 18th Century. The result of such a history is that old and non-mowed patches are small and scattered among the current salt-marsh. Taking into account history and geography of coastal habitats enables to identify the oldest and the last remaining patches of habitats that have been the less impacted by human activities. Such areas may represent a high conservation stake in the current context of massive land-cover and land-use changes in the littoral area.

AB  - Computational simplifications for a space-time autoregressive response model specification are explored for the change in Spain's per capita disposable family income between 1975 and 1983. The geographic resolution for this analysis is the provincial partitioning of part of the Iberian peninsula into Spain's 47 coterminous provinces coupled with its 3 island clusters provinces. In keeping with the Paelinckian tradition of spatial econometrics, exploration focuses on both new spatial econometric estimators and model specifications that emphasize the capturing of spatial dependency effects in the mean response term. One goal of this analysis is to differentiate between spatial, temporal, and space-time interaction information contained in the per capita disposable family income data. A second objective of the application is to illustrate the utility of extending computational simplifications from the spatial to the space-time domain. And a third purpose is to gain some substantive insights into the economic development of one country in a changing Europe. A serendipitous outcome of this investigation is a detailed analysis of locational information latent in Spain's regionally disaggregated per capita disposable family income.

AB  - The level of risk is defined by two standards  : uncertainty and vulnerability. The latter is commonly estimated by an overlay of the different information layers, in order to obtain a local quantitative measure of the exposed properties. This approach is convenient for hazardous events clearly delimited and without any spatial diffusion, such as landslides or soil pollution. This approach is however soon bounded in the case of a dynamic process, such as the hydrological hazard. The overlay of different data gives a valuable appreciation of the streaming surfaces, but this remains insufficient to express the spatial dynamics of the flow. The global sensibility of a basin is not merely the sum of the local sensibilities. The global hazard is defined by the spatial organisation of the production or infiltration areas, and by their mutual relations, which validates the cellular automata approach to measure the level of organisation of the sensitive areas and to model the diffusion of the flows between these areas.

The latter will be initially introduced before carrying out the examination of various types of practices and of reflexions into the field of ecological restoration. The examination of these debates shows to which point the separation between nature and culture on which they rest proceeds of an empiricism which denies the determining character of the environment on the individuation of the human being.

AB  - Defining what renewing territories really means proves difficult as it rests upon both countable values allowing socio-economic ranking as well as intangible values associated with city dwellers’ distinct representations and experience of urban spaces. Indeed, the values foregrounded through various urban operations vary greatly - values of change are shaping up actions and images related to the Euralille operation, the Neptune project in Dunkerque is grounded upon methodological values, while cliché and shifting values fall short of characterising the Euroméditerranée operation. Values, however heterogeneous, nurture conflicts, make up narratives and legitimise political figures, thus lying at the heart of the operational renewal process.

What's it about, a real change in teaching geography or a simple continuity of the previous public programs ? The purpose of this article is the study of the city in public programs in the last terms of elementary school. On the one hand, the city, as a teaching subject, as been a recurrent part of geographical teaching in the official government’s program, and this since 1887. On the other hand, a study of town brings to the students (who are tomorrow’s citizens) knowledge to understand their living spaces, to take a part in their transformation, at their level.   The history of public programs (from 1882 to nowadays) allowed to quantitatively reveal the topic of geography and its connection to the very organization of related concepts.

The basic methods for the estimation of fractal dimension are presented, with the focus on the interpretation of the calculated values. Fractal dimensions can be used as indicators of urban sprawl, revealing the degree of fragmentation of the urban landscape. The exploration of the above notions is based on the application in an area at the outskirts of Thessaloniki, Greece. The important changes observed between 1960 and 1990 at the urban spatial structure of the area under investigation, are discussed in the light of fractal analysis.

We set up a typology "multi-dates" conceived in order to account for the strong and permanent structures of the habitat and in housing conditions of the households of Bogota. Methodology suggested consists in defining a coherent space of reference, the whole of the households listed in 1973 and 1993 and working on usual descriptors of the morphology of the frame and housing conditions of the households, commun runs to many devices of data acquisition with robust tools of multidimensional exploratory analysis. These structures are significant with their localization and in the confrontation of the types of housing with the characteristics of the occupying households. They especially make it possible to analyze in a total way the evolution, the transformation of the habitat between 1973 and 1993 and the space dynamics of the park of housing.

AB  - The dynamics of the material reality of a city are complex to apprehend. The modelings suggested until now concern only one scale of analysis, either the one of the city or the one of the urban fabric. These two levels of analysis had never been crossed. This article seeks to assert the principles and basis of reflection for a multi-scalar modeling through the study of the abbey district of Vendôme between the 11th and 18th centuries. Although no historical interpretations could be advanced for the moment, the method implemented offers interesting potentialities to apprehend the multi-scalar relations. The cartography and the chronography are used to represent spatial dynamics of this district.

AB  - In the Lagdo region in the North-Cameroon, migrant peasants then the Agro-industrial society of the Benoue (SAIB) installed in 2000 at a strategic place for the realization of its rice and fruit cultivation project, should enhance the downstream hydroelectric dam.. As a result, this facility induced the departure of 36% of the farmers in this irrigated area. The occupation of the peasants site by the company awakened a series of land conflicts between the different actors (farmers, SAIB, elites, new generation, lamido) that have long been neglected by the decision makers. Also, the tenure insecurity has blocked the agricultural activities of SAIB and provokes the abandon of theirs equipments and the plant material in the bush. This not solved conflict by authorities amplifies the alliance between the state administration and traditional leaders, which effect lays on the identity withdrawal and the lack of interest of the population towards the agricultural development project, with the risk of asphyxia in the region.

AB  - This year's gathering in Durham marks 21 years of meetings of European quantitative geographers. The paper, originally presented at the 1999 Durham meeting, provides a review of what has been achieved. Initially the circumstances leading to the first meeting in Strasbourg (1978) are outlined. The subsequent ten meetings have seen a general, if not consistent, increase in the number of delegates and an increase in the number of nationalities represented. The papers have reflected larger changes in our discipline. Initially, work concentrated on statistical analysis of spatial data, but the 1980s saw an extension into formal mathematical modeling and what is nowadays sometimes called geographic information science. Despite, or perhaps because of, the group never having had any subsidy from EU, there have been a number of published outputs, not least of which have been research collaborations, a journal, several edited books, and inputs into other European initiatives such as the GISDATA programme. It is concluded that these gatherings can look forward to the future with confidence.

AB  - Philcarto is a software designed to map the statistical data, widely used in social sciences. Two other softwares, Phildigit and ShapeSelect turn easy the digitalization of the base maps and the use with Philcarto of cartographic covers coming from the geographical information systems Mapinfo and ArcGis. The development of these three softwares required about fifteen years. This article presents and discusses the successive choices, failures and successes which conduct to a stable product, didactic and accurate on the scientific point of view. The presentation of the historical context conducts to justify the initial effort. The necessity for the geographer to not be himself supplanted by engineering is shown. The brief presentation of the functionalities offered by the three free software leads to the comparative advantages over the expensive products. The fourth chapter clarifies and justifies the technical choices: operating systems, user interface, format of the base maps, selection of the statistical methods (multivariate and exploratory data analysis). Then comes the topic of the publication of the programs: diffusion model (on Internet) and effective public (in higher education, research and other professional environments). Series of recommendations relating to various aspects of the scientific software development are finally exposed: source code, documentation, improvement of the data-processing culture of the geographers, scientific evaluation, financing and promotion.

AB  - A comparative analysis of the spatio-temporal evolution of mosaics of forest-savannas subject to local agricultural practices was conducted in two tropical areas (Forest Guinea, Centre of Cameroon). During the last three decades, the spatial influence of the agro-forest systems or « agroforest » associating perennial crops (cocoa, coffee ...) and sub-spontaneous vegetation, strongly increased in these two regions. In Guinea, these systems, mainly based on coffee trees, developed to the detriment of spaces formerly dedicated to annual crops (pluvial rice) in rotation with fallow trees or shrubs. But a dynamic of extension of agroforests with coffee trees in the units of savannah has begun. In the centre of Cameroon, agroforest, mainly with cocoa trees, was implanted first of all in forest relicts and forest galleries. Then, due to lack of forest reserves, the farmers innovated by developing and expanding over large areas of agroforests in the zones of savannah with grasses, traditionally devoted to food-producing annual crops. This dynamic, far from being destructive, contributes to the constitution of an ecosystem « cultivated forester » or agroforest, in regions originally dominated by the savannah and the secondary forest. Faced with these relatively recent processes, the issue of sustainability of agroforests is raised, because of the increase of demand for food therefore needs land for annual crops.

The models exposed are two indexes named morphological deviation and rate of irregularity. Those indexes lead to a definition of urban fabric as a meta-system. Form is defined as the combination between shape and relative position. The shape is obtained by the discretisation of the objects' outline and its relative position is determinated by a Delaunay's triangulation.

AB  - Paleoanthropology offers an ideal practising ground to grasp the relationship scientists entertain with the space when trying to build up the scenarios of the evolution. In these attempts, the geographical determinism, declined in ecosystematic, climatic, even geologic determinism, is often the rule. Revisiting the famous and much publicized theory of East Side Story shows how the narration takes over from the scientific argumentation and underlines the difficulty of “thinking in million year terms”. Such second reading is particularly important at a moment when the creationist thesis become stronger.

Joint analyses of aerial photographs and Spot image sequence from the period 1987 to 2002, allow to measure gradually the deforestation, the impact of migratory population flows, the methods of illegal land appropriations. This study focuses on different production methods and territorialisation too, according to origins of the settlers.

AB  - Following the major changes which occurred in the " Camargue gardoise " during the sixties and the seventies, and because of the outdated " Traité des Marais " which was regulating the collective management of water levels, the economic actors dealing with water concerns have been developing individualistic policies. Water has become the origin of numerous conflicts of serious consequences concerning resources and natural spaces. The implementation of an environmental chart and of a " SAGE " in the early nineties was the outset of a comeback to a collective form of water management.However, water is still a long way from being looked-upon as a vector of territorial construction thanks to collective agreements about projects dealing with water."

AB  - Despite their spatial proximity, British and French geographers have undertaken relatively little research about each other’s countries. This article provides a reasoned –but personal - account of what has been accomplished in cross-Channel geography during the 20th century, paying attention to the authors involved, their academic milieux and their orientations within the discipline. French geographers have been especially attracted to topics in physical geography in the British Isles, whereas British geographers have emphasized research into the human and historical geography of France. Despite a certain reticence on both sides, enormous opportunities for cross-Channel research remain for the future.

AB  - Video games allow complex systems modelling, revealing retroaction loops, replicating self-organization and the emergence of hierarchical organization, functional differentiation and social segregation through multi-level interactions. Recent trends focus on improving modelling tools’ graphic quality and interface attractiveness and on using video games to facilitate urban studies teaching and research. This apparent convergence between simulation and video games is addressed through a selection of strategy and city builder video games. Comparisons reveal that simulations and video games point to similar results:, they both allow the simulation of complex urban processes, like hierarchical urban networks or urban segregation. Games even seem to allow going one step further, being often more comprehensive simulations. However, the main limitation of video games emerges from their didactic power: video games and simulation software implement rules and models in almost opposite means. Games induce players to learn the model but not to challenge or to produce new knowledge.

AB  - In France, knowledge about urban spaces can be assumed by typologies built from statistical information at the scale of municipalities or blocks (provided by the French national institute of statistics for example). Nevertheless, these typologies do not consider cities at the desegregated scale of their buildings and usually do not take into account the diversity of buildings’ residential neighborhood. But this diversity explains a part of people and households choices in terms of mobility and lifestyle. The aim of this paper is then to create a classification based on desegregated data, in order to better qualify urban spaces. After a short theoretical review about urban unity or diversity (Part 1), Part 2 presents the 46 selected indicators at the scale of the immediate, nearby or global neighborhood of the buildings. Part 3 presents the results of the classification, based on data analysis (PCA and HAC), which allow statistical and graphical generalization of the two studied areas : Besançon and Metz. These results improve knowledge about the organization and the residential attributes of urban spaces.

AB  - This paper proposes a model to generalise urban information. The model is based on autonomy, on constraints and on the representation of several levels of analysis. A geographical entity (named situation) chooses an operation which satisfies its own constraints. Generalisation is performed step by step, in an autonomous way. The final state aims at finding a compromise between constraints which incite generalisation and those which incite a preservation of geographical meaning. In this model, constraints represent the user needs on each situation. They are qualified by a level of non satisfaction which changes during the process. In order to preserve groups properties and to apply contextual operations (e.g. object removal or displacement), we introduce the concept of meso situations which are groups of objects that either generalise themselves together or analyse their properties to provide finer guideline for simple object self generalisation. Among such analysis we emphasise on distribution analysis either to ensure dissociation between values or to maintain exceptional values within a group. Actually, generalisation at the lowest level (i.e. independent) has the tendency to remove differences between characters which in term destroys geographic space specificity. These meso analysis should be more and more considered to improve the quality of generalisation process. These concepts are illustrated by urban generalisation experiments.

AB  - Cybercartography aims to rethink the way we design, use and disseminate maps on the Internet. It represents an interdisciplinary approach combining art and science, technological change and critical perspectives. This original approach is introduced in this paper through the presentation of the genesis of the Cybercartographic Atlas of Antarctica. This presentation illustrates the main characteristics of cybercartographic atlases: multisensory function, interoperability, modularity and ability to evolve. This presentation generates a discussion about the importance of rethinking the cybercartographic artifact as the outcome of a complex and subjective production process. Drawing on similar works done in different fields such as photography, the concept of “cybercartographic act” is then proposed to demonstrate that the artifact is inseparable from the act of which it is the result and that cybermaps could depict this association.

AB  - Within the transport research, modelling and simulation enable to analyse and evaluate the functioning of a mobility system which depends on the context. It is a necessary stage in order to develop and improve innovative transport service such as Demand Responsive Transport (DRT). Among various modelling approaches, Agent Based Models (ABM) are frequently used by geographers. ABMs allow to follow statistically and precisely the system advancement and we can observe intuitively spatio-temporal development of forms. This paper presents an example of theoretical flexible transport simulated with Netlogo ABM tool. Using the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol we explain the model operation, and results obtained relating to flows structuring and service optimization. Multi-agent paradigm's issues in transport research are discussed and we present some methodological and thematic perspectives.

AB  - The history of town and country planning policy in France draws the main thrust about her emergence and political changes. Within the context of Reconstruction in 1945, M.R.U conceives the "town and country planning" as an aim that comes under town planning as a branch of learning : drawing up town planning plans in municipalities, damaged or not, on a national scale. This first point of note gives rise to questions about the 20's and the 30's and the years of Occupation. The investigation inside D.G.E.N, administrative organization established by Vichy governement in 1941, reveals the magnitude of thoughts between 1941 and 1944, about "industrial decentralization" and "stroke in towns" and the continuation of work inside administrative organizations established after the Liberation, stemmed from the division in D.G.E.N, especially inside M.R.U. The survey in the 20's and the 30's outlines the circles where a thought about town planning, extended to the territory, is developping. Between 1928 and 1939, C.S.A.O.R.P expands one's sphere of activity about "industrial decentralization", in the first place an answer to the problem of "badly off", a strategic solution against the threat of air raids next. The investigation inside M.R.U between 1944 and 1950 and the identification of high-ranking officials demonstrate their stability between the 20's and the 50's, in the field of town planning. At the same time, the survey inside this group of civil servants reveals the existence of other circles, who collaborate with them and take part in discussions : geografers and economists. Last but not least, the study about scientific circles induces a special care to the debates concerning planning policy in Paris and his suburbs. The administrative and scientific role played by Jean-François Gravier instigates the birth of a discourse against the capital. "Second capital" and the connection established by S.A.R.P in 1947 between plannig in Paris and town and country planning policy induce an urban restoration policy where housing shortage plays a crucial role. Planning policy in Paris points out an eclipse of town planners on behalf of Highways Department too.

AB  - This contribution proposes to throw off the shackles of the usual rigid European rationale, which presupposes a “natural” domination of the urban centers on peri-urban areas. The focus of this paper is guided by the following hypothesis: one of the major reasons why urban sprawl is unsustainable is because it is conceived and designed as an extension of the city. Such a supposition suggests two corollaries: -Peri-urbanization may turn sustainable when based on the former non-urban land uses space (agriculture or forestry, natural areas, wastelands). -Thus, such a sustainable peri-urbanization should lead to specific and original forms of social and spatial organization (multifunctionality, lifestyles, access to nature). Moreover, this position offers a new perspective, for planners, to understand the complex reality of what is an urban area. It also helps to renew urban design and urban management, which are both usually based on the bias of continuous areas, at least simplistic and largely inadequate to think the actual disperse cities. This paper tries to determine how to foster a periurban transition to sustainability with regard to local authorities and planners actions, in relation with local communities.

AB  - More than twenty years after the collapse of the former eastern bloc, cities in central-eastern Europe are nowadays unevenly integrated to the new liberal economic system in which they are now likely to evolve. This integration was, on one hand, subject to former communist heritages and even to the previous period, and on the other hand subject to the new processes directly inherited from the new economic logic such as globalization. Network analysis of multinational firms in this area of the world can be useful in underlining different mechanisms directly issued from these logics. An empirical and comparative approach is adopted to catch and explain this phenomenon of integration of cities in Central-Eastern Europe to the world. It reveals the weight of Western Europe in the internationalization of the economy of the cities of East Central Europe (including Kiev), facing a Russian influence limited in terms of number of companies. The positions of the East Central European cities are equivalent with respect to their intense subsidiarity to foreign firms. Beside, their reciprocal trade is very limited, showing little consistency in terms of exchange of multinational companies.

AB  - The notion of life space was first proposed by geographers, then demographers, mostly interested in migration, picked up on the idea: individuals are no longer exclusively tied to their place of residence, but rather to every place with which they have a link. In empirical terms, the quantitative description of individual life spaces in demography involves two preliminary steps: delimiting the boundaries of the studied life space, according to its various dimensions; then finding the relevant specific sets of data. This paper sets out the introduction and operationalization of the notion of life space in demography, and then proposes an empirical descriptive application based on individual survey data and avenues for its use in migration studies.

AB  - The protected natural spaces where endangered species and ecosystems are preserved, shelter high populations of tall ongulated. These numerous animals present a risk for the scarce species and they increase agricultural and pastoral damages on the outskirts. The Cévennes national park is compelled by this phenomenon to practise regulating shootings in central areas. In winter, in the Spanish park of Aigues Tortes, because of the snow in high altitudes, animals are forced to progress outside the park limits where a common cynegetic regulation takes place. The elimination of some wild boars within the national park of Occidental Pyrenees could have helped to save bears while reducing beats in the closest periphery. The necessary regulation in the central zone implies to look for the actors of this management. The functionaries, too rare, could be helped by hunters holding a specific hunting licence for whom they would manage areas, dates and conditions of intervention. The presence of the wolf may become an alternative. Its trophic and territorial behaviour makes him efficient against animals of easy capture (moufflon or even cervid). The pressure on wild boars is significant only with high density of wolves. In that case, the pressure on domestic ongulated living in protected areas increases significantly and involves unbearable breeding conditions in periphery. To the binary opposition between sanctuaries and unprotected areas could succeed a gradation of more elaborated statuses. It leads to call into question our mental or cartographic representations of labelled areas.

AB  - In this article, the author presents a new methodology to study the concept of accessibility. The approach was created by the "Image et Ville" laboratory in Strasbourg between 1982 and 2002 and led to the development of specific softwares. Two definitions of accessibility —one theoretical, the other operational —, are given, but the main emphasis of the article is laid on methodology. First, the author explains the basic principles and rules underlying the construction of a database designed for the capture of information on travel times and stay times, for any given means of transport. Next, the different processing procedures, which always associate statistics, modelling and visualisation, are described. Three methods to study system accessibility, based on a global data, are suggested: marginal indices and isopleth or piezopleth maps for potential accessibility, correspondence analysis and point symbol maps with envelopes in order to determine a hierarchy of locations, in terms of accessibility, multidimensional scaling and bidimensional regression in order to "reveal" multipolar functional spaces. Subsystems accessibility studies the accessibility of specific places either through classical procedures such as unipolar isopleth maps or thanks to new methods such as isodistance maps or the construction of unipolar functional spaces. The purpose of this article, illustrated with images of Luxembourg, is purely methodological and no commented geographical examples are given. Nonetheless, this approach (summed up in a general diagram) has been applied to areas ranging from Europe to the city of Strasbourg — giving rise to numerous publications demonstrating its validity on a wide range of scales.

That brings to wonder whether the local rules of managment of water (police de l’eau) answers stakes which exceed the local and national level to serve an international policy. The local texts that restrict uses of water make it possible to evaluate the effectivity of an management of water in reference to a framework enacted at the international level whose objective is to protect water resource at the planetary level. This then raises the question of the evolution of the function of the french local authority (préfet de département). Did this one become an authority charged to transmit the rule of the national level at the local level which, in the current planetary context, would be serve a global environmental order?

AB  - Urban mobility represents a set of complex behaviors, which are difficult to measure. Independently of individual choices and motivations, these behaviors may be influenced by urban environmental characteristics. The level of physical activity is well recognized as a major determinant in the development of several chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, the obesity and some cancers. Increasing the PA level in the population through the promotion of active mobility is considered as a public health priority in France. However, there is a lack of data for analyzing active mobility (walking and cycling) as a health behavior. One of the main research challenges in this field is to better measure active mobility (in a real life context) and, at the same time, to better locate and identify places where the activity is performed. In this pilot study, we describe a method for collecting and processing data on active mobility combining motion sensors capacities (GPS and accelerometer) and implementing collected data in a Geographic Information System. Despite some limitations, the use of multi-sensor may hold potentials for collecting objective data on active mobility at a large scale.

AB  - In the past decade, analysis of flow data has been of practical concern in most studies dealing with regionalization and transportation land-use problems. Existing methodologies however show difficulties to cope with the increasing complexity of spatial structures because of the 'variety' of roles which nodes and links are likely to play within the overall interaction structure. By applying graph-theoretic considerations, it is argued that an investigation of both direction and versus of network links can reveal a whole range of spatial 'typologies' . The first section provides some arguments for a deeper understanding of flow data. It is shown that a conceptualisation of network flows as a result of interacting places defines a general framework according to which a whole range of interaction patterns (e.g. spatial structures) can be recognised. Two empirical applications of these ideas are described in the following sections. Section 3 presents an extension of the dominant-flow approach which is applied to the journey-to-work flows for the Piedmont region over the last three decades. Besides identifying the hierarchical structure, the consideration of the sub-dominant and complementary flows allows to identify a typology of relationships and get a deeper insight in the changes of the regional spatial structure during the 1971-1991 period. In section 4, an analysis of the residential mobility for the Turin metropolitan area is carried out. By analysing the sub-set of links which have a 'strict complementarity', some 'circuit-like-structures' are revealed which may be also interpreted as interlinked residential market areas.

AB  - Ideas on models and modelling made a conspicuous entry into geography in the 1960s. They have since evolved, through practice and under the influence of—partly justified—criticism. No serious research can dispense with modelling as a means to reach the essential and to evaluate the divergence between singular geographical objects and the models that assist their interpretation. On two conditions, which merit further definition and exploration : models must have meaning in and through the practices, objectives and intentions of human action ; and we must know how to use models—whether tried and tested or new—to understand the structure and dynamics of singular geographical objects, and not just to infer general mechanisms from them, even though they will certainly enhance our understanding of the nature and scope of general mechanisms.

AB  - The construction of European graduate labour market, through increased international graduate mobility, cannot take place without it appearing beneficial for graduates. Indeed, all types of mobility have a cost, even if the latter is not always financial (leaving family, adapting to a new environment, etc.). Moreover, we can wonder whether graduates employment prospects actually improve thanks to international mobility. Using the Céreq « Génération 98 » survey, our first results show that international mobility on entering the labour market appears to be rare.  Finally, this experience abroad is also valued if the graduates re-enter the French labour market: the mobile graduates have more frequently jobs with high-levels of responsibility and earn more than those who stayed in France.

AB  - Based on the Swedish Standard Industrial Classification and individual longitudinal data, by using the shift-share analysis method, Swedish regional employment growth during the 1990s has been decomposed into two components—growth due to an endogenous regional factor and growth due to an exogenous structural factor. The regional factor is more important in shaping regional growth than the structural factor as indicated by employment, although the two factors both have a positive relation to regional growth. The structural factor creates a macro milieu for a region and the regional factor generates a micro milieu for industries inside the region. The response of core regions to the economic downturn and recovery in Sweden in the period studied is stronger than that of periphery regions. The findings from this study support endogenous growth theories and core-periphery theory.

Ceci est particulièrement vrai de l'espace où se produisent les déplacements domicile-travail, ou migrations alternantes.<br />Après avoir examiné les définitions successives des zones d'emploi, des zones d'aires urbaines, des bassins de vie, des unités territoriales et des pays, nous analyserons les inconvénients qu'elles présentent pour une analyse des migrations alternantes, en particulier l'obligation d'exclusivité pour une commune et d'appartenance unique à une aire centrée sur un pôle avec le corollaire de la continuité spatiale. Comme &quot;tout acte de représentation&quot; écrit Bailly (1992) est &quot;un acte de création&quot; et que &quot;le réel, s'il existe, ne prend sons sens qu'en fonction de nos construits&quot;, nous allons proposer pour analyser les migrations alternantes et les bassins d'emploi une nouvelle approche plus ouverte apparentée à la notion de champ que nous nommerons : systèmes locaux pour l'emploi ou (SLE).<br />Nous allons donc considérer l'espace communal comme soumis potentiellement à des champs d'attraction centrés sur chacun des pôles que l'on définira : les centres d'emploi. Une commune est soumise à plusieurs attractions possibles et les aires géographiques qui en découlent, pôle par pôle, peuvent se chevaucher. L'espace global, départemental par exemple, ne constitue plus une partition, une commune pouvant être dans le champ de bassins et de sous-bassins. La méthodologie a consisté à calculer pour chaque pôle et pour chaque commune attirée, l'attraction ou la probabilité d'être attirée comme la proportion d'actifs qui vont travailler dans le centre parmi l'ensemble des actifs qui vont travailler à l'extérieur.<br />Appliqué aux Pyrénées-Atlantiques, ce type d'analyse a permis de mettre en évidence des emboîtements et inclusions de bassins, d'observer une formation en deux sous-systèmes bien distincts, l'un autour de Pau et l'autres autour de Bayonne avec une grande zone intermédiaire vide de migrants. Sauf pour les bassins industriels de forme linéaire, tous les bassins ont une forme aréolaire. Si les plus gros bassins ont cinq couches d'attraction concentriques, lorsqu'on descend dans la hiérarchie urbaine, les bassins d'ordre 2 sont inclus dans ceux d'ordre 1 : on passe à quatre couches et ainsi de suite jusqu'au bourgs-centres. Il y a très peu de chevauchements d'une couche sur l'autre, malgré la présence d'axes routiers privilégiés et de vallées montagnardes ; La frontière départementale constitue au nord comme à l'est une véritable frontière et la surdensité du Pays basque se lit dans les inclusions des bassins qui peuvent aller jusqu'à quatre niveaux.</p></r2r:ml>

AB  - With the diffusion of the principles of systems dynamics, geography has experienced an important evolution since the 1980s. Consequently, the development of cellular automata or multi-agent systems and their progressive coupling with geographic information systems have taken place. Recent works have shown that the problem of urban sprawl was particularly well-suited to this kind of systems. In this paper, we focus on the formalization of dynamics, where we propose to simulate the urban growth under the congestion constraint. In order to design this model, we combine operating and interaction assumptions of urban spaces such as gravitation or fluid mechanics (theory of traffic). We also propose to check the validity of this system at the municipal level for the urban area of Dijon and to validate the growth hypotheses of this city and the ones of its suburban area by 2030.

Initially, the contributions of the geometry enabled cartographers to represent physical geographical Then, the contributions of the statistics made it possible to represent abstracted phenomena and thems on topographical maps, by structuring information before communicating it graphically and efficiently. Today, the contributions offered by the new data-processing possibilities offer new possibilities. They mainly rely on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and on the experience of Eploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The main characteristics of this multimedia and interactive cartography can be structured in a synthetic figure. Cartographic evolutions are presented as “added values”, calling upon different senses, with different levels of interactivity. These new possibilities contribute to modify cartography and particullarly its role of communication, as well as the relationship between the actors that emit and the actors that receive the cartographical information.

AB  - Cities and transport networks have been intertwined through history and are still related despite the impacts of telecommunications. While each transport network has its own purpose, actors, rules and regulations, the position of cities in such networks reveals their complementarities. This paper analyzes the hierarchy and the specific roles of cities in two worldwide transport networks: air passengers and maritime freights. These two networks were chosen despite noticeable differences in terms of spatial and economic organization, albeit they both have essential respective roles in urban development. Three levels of delineation of urban areas are tested in order to evaluate their influence on network structure, hierarchy of centrality, and correlations between networks. The measurement of specialization and polarization among cities allows proposing a typology where “independent gateway cities” occupy bridge positions within and between nodal regions. This research clarifies the interdependency between cities and between networks in the processes of globalization, regionalization, and urban development.

AB  - There is no formalised theory of sustainable urban mobility systems. Observed patterns of urban mobility are often considered unsustainable. But we don’t know what a city with sustainable mobility should look like. It is nevertheless increasingly apparent that the urban mobility system plays an important role in the achievement of the city’s wider sustainability objectives. In this paper we explore the characteristics of sustainable urban mobility systems through the technique of Bayesian networks. At the frontier between multivariate statistics and artificial intelligence, Bayesian networks provide powerful models of causal knowledge in an uncertain context. Using data on urban structure, transportation offer, mobility demand, resource consumption and environmental externalities from seventy-five world cities, we developed a systemic model of the city-transportation-environment interaction in the form of a Bayesian network. The network could then be used to infer the features of the city with sustainable mobility. The Bayesian model indicates that the city with sustainable mobility is most probably a dense city with highly efficient transit and multimodal mobility. It produces high levels of accessibility without relying on a fast road network. The achievement of sustainability objectives for urban mobility is probably compatible with all socioeconomic contexts. By measuring the distance of world cities from the inferred sustainability profile, we finally derive a geography of sustainability for mobility systems. The cities closest to the sustainability profile are in Central Europe as well as in affluent countries of the Far East. Car-dependent American cities are the farthest from the desired sustainability profile.

AB  - Created in a multidisciplinary research program, the IDURAMAZ system of indicators focuses on the territorial impacts of different projects of sustainable development implemented in Amazonian rural areas during the last twenty years. Originally constructed to be subdivided in 4 synthetic indexes, 14 indicators and 44 sub-indicators related to socioeconomic, environmental, institutional and generational questions, we wanted to reduce the number of its components and its architecture in order to obtain a dashboard of more relevant indicators. During the realization of the key indicators selection, we aimed two principal goals. First, turning our methodology more intelligible to the targeted public by conserving the most explicit indicators and limiting the use of composed ones (those that are constructed with different variables). Second, facilitating the research on the determinants of sustainability, that means the most important criteria for the success or the fail of the projects realized in its name. This paper exposes the principles that have piloted the selection of the key indicators, the results obtained as to the key factors of sustainability and some reflections about the themes to be added. Behind the reflections on the DURAMAZ project and its indicators system, this paper has a more general range on the way to select a core set of indicators to approach the question of sustainability.

For these two small islands of the Indian Ocean far from any major land, air connections are like threads which extend to the major tourist-generating countries, especially European ones. Until recently the tourists were mainly transported by Seychelles and Mauritian airlines, flagships of their country. But these national carriers, struggling to adapt to the situation, had to fold their wings and cancel numerous routes.

AB  - São Gabriel da Cachoeira is the main city of the Upper Rio Negro, in the Far North-West of Brazil. Being the only “big” city of a vast and scarcely populated region of more than 200 000 km², the town can be considered as its metropolis, even if it counts only little more than 13 000 inhabitants. This paper analyses the regional system or the upper basin of the Rio Negro, very peculiar as compared to other brazilian regions, and the city’s role as a regional capital city. The foundation of São Gabriel occured in the late XVIIIth century, about a century after the first Portuguese entered the region. It remained mostly atone during one more century, before the arrival of the salesian missionaries in the early XXth. Those made of it the center of their activity, which, in turn, made of São Gabriel a urban reference for the whole “dog’s head” (as the brazilian design that part of their territory whose border roughly sketches a dog’s head) region. During the second part of the XXth century, the federal government of Brazil will reinforce its presence in the area, as a part o a strategy aimed at strengthening its controle over distant regions. Its action will follow the salesian model, implanting distant outposts along the principal rivers and using São Gabriel as a central base for its activities. Thus, the city progressively sees a reinforced presence of armed forces, as well as of other federal agencies. But it is also the only access to a vast region that outlies the brazilian border, and as such it benefits itself of all the regional commercial activity. More recently, it has been stressed that São Gabriel lies in a region where population is in its majority formed by descendant of amerindians, and is located in a little enclave within large Indian lands, motivating big NGOs, financed localy and internationaly, to install there centers of operations and to develop alternative socio-economical programs. The recent dynamics of the city points out rapid growth, even if it remains modest if one take into acount the modestness of the population involved and the smalness of the urbanized area. In a most original way within Brazil, it seems to grow without promoting a wide deforestation and the newly installed populations retain strong ties with their original comunity. São Gabriel thus appears not only to be a city within the forest, but most profoundly a true rainforest city.

This is investigated making use of an overarching methodological framework based on the internationally accepted Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model, developed by the OECD. Additional to the simple causal flow from drivers to responses are the dynamic relationships between these five aspects. The paper discusses each of these issues and the relationships between them as they pertain to gated communities in South Africa. Gated communities, as complex systems, necessitate the consideration of a multiplicity of feedback loops with internal rates of flow that are determined by non-linear relationships. Only in this way can the full extent of their impact and implications on urban sustainability be assessed.

AB  - A study was conducted in a Sahel pastoral area in Mauritania from 1987 to 1989 which involved the application of satellite sensor images to ground surveys, to determine the surface areas of different types of land cover and in particular those suitable for raising livestock. In the preparation phase, satellite sensor images were used in conjonction with the sampling plan that monitored the land cover inventory. During the ground survey phase, images representing enlarged survey units were used to complement the survey records. Finally, in the analytical phase, remote sensing was used not only to draw ground inventory maps but also to correct, by regression, the estimation of the surface areas of the various categories of land cover detected. The findings of our study show that remote sensing, while allowing for a reduced sample size during the ground survey phase, provides for a high level of accuracy in the estimation of surface areas.

AB  - Since the start of the project of the Atlas électronique du Québec et de ses régions, the implementation of regional atlases began timidly but seriously. The works produced in the regions of Bas-Saint-Laurent and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean surely are intiatives that not only have inclined researchers to use new ways to communicate information but also have contributed to elaborate useful geographic "savoirs". The Project of the Atlas électronique du Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, which has been running for some years, may give evidence of the important role played by a team of researchers in a region where social-economic problems, questions of development and land planning, utilization of natural resources, and municipal re-structuration are the menu of the day.

AB  - We present an analysis of the particle accelerator families from the cyclotron to the proton collider LHC at CERN. Different properties of these families characterize a complex system. Jumps of technologic innovation provide very important leaps of projectile energies. Chronology of these jumps could be explained by a log periodic law. Such a law succeeds in analyzing the chronologies of primates, rodents, equidae and, even, financial crashes. Acceleration and deceleration of evolution define a critical epoch Tc. We conclude that new technologies are necessary in the future for the survival of the High Energy Physics.

At first, characterictics of bioclimates and soils are evoked. Then, consequences oh human activities are made clear to the mind because, for a long time , the heath formed the major basis of the whole agrarian system. In conclusion, the writer place in a prominent position some gradients and considers that the determinism is on the dependance of scales (spatial and temporal). Although this one is not easy to define, man plays a preponderant action in the heaths birth, their localisation and their evolution.

AB  - Ports that are able to offer scale economies on land by using combined transport gain a competitive advantage in their port range. The recent rapid expansion of combined waterway-road services at French ports, Le Havre and Marseille, led us to carry out a theoretical and empirical analysis of the causes and conditions that underlie this development. In order to more clearly understand the dynamics of the French situation, attention has been broadened to include other competing European ports, Antwerp and Rotterdam. The four stage theoretical model highlights the interdependence between the setting up of combined waterway-road services, the competition between ports and the competition between shipping lines.

AB  - Wide collection on the historic records of the climatic changes and flood events is performed in the Yangtze Delta. Mann-Kendall (MK) method is applied to explore the changing trends of the time series of the flood frequency and humidity during 1000-1950 and the flood discharge and the maximum high summer temperature during 1950-2002. The research results indicate that the flood magnitudes increased during the transition from the medieval warm interval into the early Little Ice Age. Fluctuating climate changes of the Little Ice Age characterised by arid climate events followed by the humid and cold climate conditions give rise to the frequent flood hazards. Low-lying terrain made the study region prone to  flood hazards, storm tide and typhoon. MK analysis reveals that flood frequency during 1000-1950 is in negative trend before 1600 AD and is in positive trend during 1600-1950, but not at 95 % significance level. The humidity is in positive trend after 1300s, and during 1700-1800 this positive trend is at >95 % level. Close connections occurred between wet climatic conditions and the high flood frequency. The abrupt point of the time series of the flood discharge changes is the middle 1960s and that of the maximum summer temperature changes is at the middle 1990s, the exact abrupt point is at  1993. The flood discharge changes show a negative trend before 1990s, and a positive tendency after the 1990s; the maximum high summer temperature changes are on a negative trend before the 1990s and on positive tendency afterwards. These results indicate that the trend of flood discharge matches that of the maximum high summer temperature in the Yangtze Delta. The occurrence probability of the maximum high summer temperature will be increasing under the climatic warming scenario  which will in turn increase the occurrence probability of the flood events. More active solar action epochs and the higher sea surface temperature index (SST index) of the south Pacific Ocean area that lies between 4°N~4°S and 150°W~90°W are corresponding to increased annual precipitation, flood discharge and occurrence frequency of floods in the Yangtze Delta. This is partly because the intensified solar activities and the higher SST index give rise to accelerated hydrological circulation from the ocean surface to the continent, resulting in increased precipitation and higher occurrence possibility of flood hazards on the continent.

AB  - Recently, fractal theory has become popular in urban geography. Actually, its formalisation is compatible with many characteristics of the urban systems : self-similarity in clustering and fragmentation of spatial patterns at different scales, hierarchical organisation, sinuosity of borders, and non linear dynamics. First, we recall how fractal properties can be related to important features of urban morphology just as easily as to the evolution of urban systems. Second, we briefly review the main trends in the application of fractals to urban issues : the description of urban morphologies (built-up areas, distribution of activities, networks, borders…), the simulation of urban growth and settlement systems analysis. A specific application to the question of urban limits will be presented in detail. Issues of relevance and validation will be discussed, especially regarding the combination of different types of spatial structures.

The causes of this exodus, for exodus applies if one speaks about diaspora, plunge in the history of ancient China and the major values of its civilization.

AB  - In this note I will shortly focus on the question of scale in the modelling of populations’ spatial mobility. Let us simply consider the case of three organisational levels : at the top, a region as a whole, for instance a country or a group of countries (macro-level), at an intermediate level a set of spatial units, for example the departments or the communes (meso-level) and at the bottom the individuals (micro-level). The question is, for a specific problem, to choose the most adapted level to develop a model. In many circumstances, there is no ambiguity, the level is induced by the problem. But in other cases, there is a possible choice. For example, if one wants to understand and to simulate the spatial redistribution of the population within a regional system during a certain period of time, the result of the model is expected to be given at a meso-level, but the model can be developed either within the framework of microsimulation, or within that of synergetics, each implying its proper philosophy. One privileges hypotheses on individuals’ behaviour, the other focuses on processes that refer to a meso-level logic. The aim here is to underline what conceptual differences are induced by these two approaches,.

Results show that family organisation has strong effects on wealth levels and distribution and on demographic growth. They also suggest a historic shift from the patriarchal mode to a mono-nuclear mode in the 70's in this specific area, due to a higher resilience of the latter thanks to a broader diversification and a better adequacy between wealth and family demography.

AB  - This paper highlights the difficulties for creating the Amazonian Parc in French Guiana. The project was initiated during the Environment and Development Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992. The area selected for the park is located in the South of French Guiana and covers approximately three million hectares of the Guyanese forest, which is estimated at more than eight million hectares. The project’s initial objective was to protect the environment and mainly to preserve the biodiversity of this part of French Guiana. As soon as the project started, the main objective to preserve the natural character of the area was confronted not only to economic activities mainly related to gold mining, but also to the strong need of lands for agricultural activities by local population, essentially communities of Amerindians and Bushinengue. The retrospective and comparative mapping of several proposals of the park location and its spatial organization, together with field investigation and interviews, permit to highlight some conflicts of interest from various actors and communities involved. By simplifying the definition and the role of nature preservation devoted to national parks in France, especially in their outer edges which are now considered as areas of “sustainable development”, the new law on national parks, adopted by the French National Assembly in December 2005, has contributed significantly to the progress of the French Guiana national Park project which has been finally completed in February 2007. According to the new law, the national park of French Guiana, named Amazonian Park of Guiana, is no longer a strict tool for the preservation of nature and the protection of biodiversity, but a tool which combine environmental conservation and sustainable development. The achievement of this project highlights recent progress of the european concepts regarding nature and protected areas in the international context of biodiversity and sustainable development issues.

AB  - Portugal has launched an ambitious energy transition strategy, such as other European countries. To reach this goal, it committed to triple its production capacities of renewable in comparison with the situation in 2005, by 2020. Incentive policies helped to strongly increase the capacities of wind power. Nevertheless this considerable development of wind energy is limited by the unpredictable intermittency of production which requires a large increase in hydropower potential including the implementation of several reservoirs and pumped-storage plants. Portugal has launched since 2007 what is described as “the most important hydroelectricity project in Europe over the last 25 years”. However the construction of eight new dams provokes protests in the name of environment, heritage and landscapes protection. Indeed a new dam is built in the Upper Douro valley, a UNESCO World Heritage site, which has been listed for the value of its iconic vineyards landscapes. The various local conflicts in the Portuguese valleys and the protection of the traditional landscapes show the complexity of implementation of renewables, even when the aims of the planners seem to be compatible with concerns of environmentalist protesters, such as an ambitious policy of energy transition. Thus the Portuguese case shows the complexity to set up energy transition.

AB  - Built on S. Lupasco’s logic and L. Bolk’s neoteny, the 2009 paper [Reymond, 2009a] proposed a geographical model with a transdisciplinary cybernetic framework. The present paper, its continuation, shows that neoteny, a concept still difficult to quite settle into yet, can, however, be at the root of homo geographicus and the technical objects that he creates and, in particular, these concentrations of population we call cities. With this object in mind, the paper regroups the concepts of sphere (P. Sloterdijk), enaction (F.J. Varela), transduction (G. Simondon) and fractality (B. Mandelbrot) which, embedded into Lupasco’s logic, leads toward a geographical theory joining contradictory antagonism to mediance (A. Berque) and space/range (H. Reymond). In this context, the paradigm of complexity and H. Reichholf’s surplus theory are used and accepted, without having been deeply examined, and a development of the urbanization phenomenon in three phases is suggested : eco-anthroposystemic, biospherically limited, anthropo-geosystemic, economically unbridled, and geo-anthroposystemic, ecologically thought-out. This geohistoric reading of the geosystem concept results in an epistemological reflection on the elaboration of a geoanthropological ethics.

AB  - Landscape evaluation is an interesting field for fuzzy approaches, because it happens on the transition line between natural and social systems. Both are very complex. Therefore, transformation of scientific results to politically significant statements on environmental problems demands intelligent support. Particularly landscape planners need methods to gather natural facts of an area and assess them in consideration of its meaning to society as a whole. Since each land unit is heterogeneous, a special methodology is necessary. Such an evaluation technique was developed within a Geographical Information System (ARC/INFO). The methodology combines several known methods with fuzzy approaches to catch the intrinsic fuzziness of ecological systems as well as the heterogeneity of landscape. Additionally, a way will be discussed to vary the fuzzy inference in order to consider spatial relations of various landscape elements. Fuzzy logic is used to process the data uncertainty, to simulate the vagueness of knowledge about ecological functionality, and to model the spatial structure of landscape. Fuzzy sets describe the attributes of thematically defined land units and their assessment results. In this way, the available information will be preserved in their full diversity. The fuzzy operations are executed by AML-programs (ARC/INFO Macro Language). With such a tight coupling, it is possible to use the geographical functions (neighbourhoods, distances, etc.) of GIS within the fuzzy system directly.

AB  - This study examines the population redistribution in Sweden at municipality level between 1970 and 1996. The aims of this study are to analyse : (1) the importance of migration and geographical variations in fertility and mortality for the redistribution of population between municipalities in Sweden from 1970 to 1996 ; and (2) the impacts of age composition in municipalities versus local age-specific fertility, mortality and migration rates on changes in population distribution. The population change in each municipality was calculated as if it was only affected by one demographic factor at the time. The results of these counterfactual scenarios were compared to actual population change and the effect of fertility, mortality, in- and out-migration and age composition was thereby isolated. Measurements of concentration have been used in order to analyse the changing population distribution. The main demographic factor behind the redistribution since 1970 is the geographical differences in age composition and its effects on the natural population change. It is demonstrated that this factor lies behind the trend towards increasing concentration in Sweden, while the impact of migration affects the fluctuations from this trend to a greater extent.

Coming back to empirical features of urban dynamics on a very long term and for a very large set of towns and cities (Europe, 1600-2000) brings new hypothesis which will be introduced in further formulations of the model.

This bay, considered as the showcase of the capital city of the Philippines, has focused all the efforts in terms of urban management since Ferdinand Marcos came to power in 1965. Through the control of the population and the spaces, the setting of the Martial Law in 1972 still influences the urban governance, which is dominated by government institutions/offices and estate companies, although the civil society finds ways to express itself through official consultation procedures. Yet, the Manila Bay management project is now completed according to the Marcos era plan, in a democratic frame, with a low level of renewal among the urban governance offices and its elites.

AB  - The suburban way of life is tending towards a rejection of tangible confrontation with otherness so that other people – should they be different – become politically invisible. This is at any rate what the critical literature surmises about the growing desire of suburbanites to live amongst their own and sometimes even behind the safe and reassuring walls of gated communities. However appealing this analysis might be, it seems nonetheless rather partial. Suburban populations are increasingly mobile and their everyday horizon is less and less reduced to the immediate perimeter of the neighbourhood. Indeed, how can one interpret the social specialization of residential areas as a sign of “enclavism” when all the statistics available indicate that mobility has become a constitutive factor of people’s way of life and the neighbourhood has all but lost its existential weight? Based on exploratory work, this paper aims to deconstruct the criticism articulated around the opposition of “suburbanism” and “urbanism” by emphasising the effects of the various forms of mobility and showing that they complement the proliferation of homogeneous neighbourhoods. In order to achieve this goal, the paper analyses the culture of people living at the periphery of two large French cities (Paris and Lyon). The arguments given are based both on the existing literature and on research the author carried out in France (Charmes, 2005). As a result of the analysis conducted, it becomes apparent that the increase in mobilities and the social homogenisation of neighbourhoods can be linked in other ways than the one suggested by the critical literature. On the one hand, contemporary residential areas are not as neutral and sterile as they appear to be. Relationships between neighbours and interactions with people from the surroundings constitute at least an embryonic experience of otherness. Residential areas can therefore be conceived as “transition spaces” between the protected space of the home and the relatively unknown spaces of the large metropolis. On the other hand, the paper defends the hypothesis that mobilities tend to reinforce the need for stability and control of one’s immediate space. Mobilities have lead city dwellers out of the reassuring cocoon of the neighbourhood in which almost everyone was swathed only a few decades ago. This growing uncertainty of life enhances the need to withdraw to a home “base”. However, this need is temporary and only concerns isolated moments of everyday life. The general tendency remains one of dispersal of spatial practices and individualisation of experience.

This paper explores one such evolution, that is, the generalisation of individual meters. Examples of arguments favouring this are that they will help avoiding wasteful use of water, they will permit consumer responsabilisation, and they will ensure greater equity. However, technical, economic, and social problems appear. Relations between inhabitants and various water management actors are transformed because the circulation of water in collective dwellings reveals the complexity of everyday life.

However, its catchment basin planning has been at the heart of significant controversies for the last decades. The opposition between developers and environmental protectors has been strong but profitable insofar as it has been helping the transition from a technician watercourse management method – which prioritizes watercourse control through important developments regardless of their environmental effects – to an environmental management method – which strives to articulate planning while preserving the natural balances existing in hydrosystems. Studying the Loire catchment basin may thus highlights the rise of a new and more environment conscious watercourse management method.

AB  - Fractal geometry is a fundamental approach for describing the complex irregularities of the spatial structure of point patterns. The present research characterizes the spatial structure of the Swiss population distribution in the three Swiss geographical regions (Alps, Plateau and Jura) and at the entire country level. The analyses were carried out by means of a fractal measure (the box-counting dimension) and two multifractal measures (the Rényi generalized dimensions and the multifractal spectrum) for point patterns, which enabled the estimation of the spatial degree of clustering of a distribution at different scales. The Swiss population dataset is presented on a grid of points and thus it can be modelled as a realization of a "point process" where each point is characterized by its spatial location (geometrical support) and a number of inhabitants (measured variable). Results showed that the four patterns are multifractals and their population distribution present different clustering behaviours. Thus, applying multifractal and fractal methods at different geographical regions and at different scales allowed us characterising the degree of clustering of the population distribution in Switzerland and quantifying their dissimilarities. This paper is the first Swiss geodemographic study applying multifractal methods using high resolution data.

AB  - The presented study shows the results of the processing of Google Earth images leading to the delineation of West Africa urban areas with more than 500 000 inhabitants. Since Google Earth images are RGB images with no spectral information, the developed methodology is based on the processing of grey level images in order to retrieve urban areas according to their texture with the help of morphological filters. Images covering some of the studied agglomerations are mosaic images resulting of the composition of satellite images acquired in different conditions. Thus a pre-processing step of image equalization is added in order to reduce the luminance differences and facilitate the extraction. We present here an equalization method based on the « Midway » algorithm, originally developed to standardize the luminance of pairs of stereo images. The challenge here is to adapt the algorithm to be able to treat images with partially different contents. Once the mosaics are equalized, it is possible to use sequences of morphological filters in order to delineate urban areas. The results are compared and validated with the Africapolis vectorial database of urban areas identified by mean of photo interpretation, as well on Google Earth images.

AB  - Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent and widespread vector-borne disease in temperate zones of the northern hemisphere. It is considered as an emerging disease, since its recognition as a distinct clinical entity in 1977, and its incidence has increased rapidly during the past decades. In this paper, we briefly examine the emerging character of the disease, first by defining the notion of emergence which is too often ambiguous. From a strict epidemiological standpoint, it is almost impossible to generalize about its emergence, especially considering the great variety of situations and contexts (geographical, biological, socio-economic). Presently, Lyme borreliosis seems to pose a new public health problem in heavily urbanized areas due to high population densities and a large number of people that visit urban forests. The hypothesis of an increase in contamination, which is work in progress, is very likely to appear in the Île-de-France region, especially around the forest of Sénart. In order to anticipate potential disease outbreaks in infected areas, it is necessary to consider exposure and risk factors. The analysis of contacts between the itineraries that people adopt in forests and the spaces and environments considered to be “risky” constitutes a privileged avenue of study. Consequently, there is a need to study these spatial dynamics (and to model this kind of contact), as well as to study ways in which it is possible to minimize risk by modifying the landscape.

We analyse this work, which has been neglected in France, from the dual perspective of the dynamics of cities and the control of territory. Botero is highly original when listing and comparing the causes of urban attraction, while his ideas on government are more representative of the concepts of his time. But taken as a whole, what is sketched out in the work by this Renaissance author is indeed a new representation of territoriality.

AB  - Periodically geographies split up into specialisations linked to scientific evolutions and ideological fluctuations. Consecutively, this splitting involves reunification's tentatives. In 1978-1980, at the beginning of the actual dismemberment phase, three axioms of geography (chorological, of situation, chronological) were suggested to substitute the unifying vidalian principles of geography. The basic mechanism of the axioms, the differenciation/differentiation, was correct, but the formulation of the chorological axiom was circular. It was reformulated in the shape of two chorological definitions of the geography's object serving as fundament to a logic. This was not an umpteenth tentative of geographies' reunification but a starting point to create a language allowing communication between geographies. The two other axioms, which refer to principles that are not suited to geographies, are abandoned.

AB  - In France, the municipalities exposed to major risks have the legal obligation to inform citizens through a document namely DICRIM [Document d’Information Communale sur les Risques Majeurs in French]. This tool aims at informing population on the nature, occurrence and spatial distribution of local risks and also at giving safety instructions and behavior individuals have to adopt in case of a severe event. But only a few percent of the 27 754 exposed municipalities answers to such obligation: 8% according to the BD-DICRIM data base; 20% according to the data advanced by the French Ministry of Environment. To further assessing the number of real DICRIM and to explain why most municipalities neglect the law, a phone survey has been carried out on four departments (Loire, Loiret, Loire-Atlantique and Vaucluse) chosen as studied sites. The 727 answers permit to: 1) quantify the gap between official data and reality; 2) measure explicative role on the DICRIM state-of-art of institutional factors (membership in a links between local authorities, realization of a management plan face to crisis, the Plan Communal de Sauvegarde in French) or geographical (number of risks at local scales, proximity to a major river) and demographic variables (importance of the population); 3) to verify the conformity of collected DICRIM in front of the legislation.

AB  - This article is about uncertainty and formalization of the archaeological time. During an archaeological excavation, in order to produce reports and basic chronological information, the archaeologist has to create a first chronological model, with the stratigraphic sequence (Harris matrix), and the available indicators of quantified time (terminus post quem, terminus ante quem). This model may be formalized, particularly the realization of the Harris matrix (graph of stratigraphic chronology). However, at this stage, this model may be affected by uncertainty of stratigraphic observations (because of their empirical nature), and it has to deal with the imprecision of the data of quantified time. From an epistemological point of view, taking this uncertainty into consideration may strengthen the scientific validity of the archaeological reasoning. The formalization exposed below corresponds to this chronological reasoning operated by the archaeologist during archaeological excavations. It gave rise to operational computing tools (application Le Stratifiant). Simple tools of modal logic allow to treat this uncertainty. This formalization takes place upstream to more complex modelling.

AB  - This social geographical inquiry shows how peripheral university students connect their everyday living spaces. Based on quantitative and qualitative evidence, this article explores the living spaces and mobility practices of students from Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée University. Mobility issue is at stake in East Paris, a space between Paris city, suburbs and the surrounding rural area, characterized by polycentrism. In a context of large and polycentric in-between spaces, students experience a high mobility level. It does not mean emancipation. At the opposite, it reveals a stronger dependence towards parents’assets, family car uses and public transports. Thus, students are unequal as regards to mobility facilities. At the end, the article shows that these students have practices quite similar with suburban “franciliens”, and more precisely with carless households. Resulting from a negotiation between choices and constraints, proximity and distance, they create original living spaces.

AB  - This paper argues that there may be considerable advantages to including indicators within geodemographic systems that represent workplace-based characteristics and the commuting linkages between areas. Using the regional example of Yorkshire and Humberside in northern England, we indicate how a suite of workplace-based and residence-workplace linkage variables relating to the labour market can be assembled and used alongside a suite of residence-based (or demand) variables to generate a new area classification. Spatial interaction models are calibrated to derive some of the variables that take into account area self-containment and catchment size.

AB  - This paper presents a reflection on how relevant it is to assess the vulnerability of the infrastructures on which people’s daily mobility relies in order to understand, at an upper level, the territorial vulnerabilities. Once defined the concepts involved in this analysis and after a brief description of the research framework, the four steps thought process is detailed. The first step was to analyse people’s daily mobility (motivation, trips volume, origin and destination) and the transportation system (offer and network) within the Metropolitan District of Quito (MDQ). This allowed pinpointing in a second step, key elements within road and transportation network referred to as critical infrastructures. The third step was to assess the critical infrastructure vulnerabilities which expose them to disturbances or failures. The fourth step was to identify all the areas which are liable to experiment a reduction of their accessibility due to a loss of critical infrastructures serviceability. This allowed assessing finally through scenarios the spatial backlashes which are likely to occur at the MDQ scale.

AB  - In this paper, we present our research about the concept of central tendancy or location. The meAdian is first presented as a robust location estimator, built using the mean and the median linear combination and their variance assessment by a bootstrap. Despite its theoretical statistical efficiency, the meAdian is tested on several empirical batches of data, often encountered during spatial analysis process such as spatial filtering. We then study the meAdian behaviour relating to the p value of the Lp-norms and conclude on a discussion and further researches developed to locate the “optimal centre”. This paper completes the one previously published in Cybergeo Press, which describes some of the (ma)thematical aspects of the meAdian (Josselin & Ladiray, 2002a).

AB  - The climatic criterion impacts the behaviour and the decision of individuals and social groups; thus, it is a major component of the territory life. Therefore, dividing space according to different climate types is worth to be achieved by using updated data processing resources. With this aim in view, the authors suggest a spatial approach for defining climates and their geographical limits. Taking into account measurements made by Météo-France recording stations, a data set related to temperature and precipitation is worked out for a 30 years period (1971-2000), it includes 14 variables able to characterize the climates and their specific variability. An original method, so called Local interpolation, allows to represent each of the 14 variables as a continuous field and to store them in the form of GIS data layers. These data are then processed by coupling Correspondence Analysis and Ascending Hierarchical Classification in order to obtain a typology where 8 climates are identified and mapped on the French continental territory. An additional process using a probabilistic method enables to map the potential distribution space of each climate and to shade the strict type delimitation such as it is given by classification. A final synthesis leads to interpret the obtained results within the frame of a general climate understanding. Two annexes enable to download the cartographic documentation related to this paper.

AB  - Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support System (MC-SDSS) is one of the most common tools for solving the spatial decision problems. Using the MC-SDSS in the Web 2.0 environment enhances the collaborative decision making by providing a flexible problem-solving framework, where the relevant GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools and information are provided for active participation/collaboration. However, the Web 2.0-based collaborative GIS-MCDA knowledge including the user generated content (preferences/opinions) and the GIS-MCDA elements are not machine-understandable. Thus, such knowledge cannot be interpreted, processed, searched, shared, and reused by the Web-based software agents and applications. Additionally, the GIS-MCDA models are often constructed based on the knowledge and understanding that arises out of the subjective viewpoints and they lack a shared and common reference for collaboration, thus making it hard for participants to collaboratively solve the decision problem. To address these problems, this paper proposes the Web 3.0-based collaborative MC-SDSS, which integrates the Web 2.0 (a Web of people) community methods and the Semantic Web (a Web of meaning) technologies. The collaborative/participatory GIS-MCDA knowledge is semantically modeled in an ontological framework as a backbone of the Semantic Web. The ontology is needed to express the collaborative GIS-MCDA knowledge in a shared, unified, structured, meaningful, and machine-interpretable form, ready for software agents and people to interpret, process, communicate, share, and reuse it. The paper demonstrates an implementation of the proposed Web 3.0-based MC-SDSS for solving the parking site selection problem in Tehran, Iran.

AB  - Geographical knowledge is here considered as a field organised around scientific geography, school geography, applied geography and “unofficial” geographies (ie : directed to the general public). In complete opposition with the popular (in France at least) “ didactic transposition model ” (which considers school curriculum as tightly linked to the scientific geography elaborated in the Academic world) it is here defended that each of these two geographical knowledge evolve more or less independently. In fact, when adopting a broader point of view, to include not only applied but also “unofficial” geographies in the field of geographical knowledge, it appears that each of these four kinds of knowledge are developing themselves in a rather autonomous way, each of them being one pole around which a part of the general geographical knowledge is continuously built on. When school and applied geographies contribute to the elaboration of new research orientations in the field of scientific geography and to the diffusion of its results, “unofficial” geography reflects and expresses the general public´s main interests in geography. Each of the four poles is set in a specific area where geographical knowledge is created and used, and is open to other fields of knowledge.

AB  - The spatial influence of cities can be apprehended from the way in which innovation diffuses, from the presence of modern and “rare” or out-of-the-ordinary activities, and from the networks formed by companies operating a number of sites. The analysis of these diffusion patterns casts light on the spatial dynamics in Tunisia in recent times, on the explicative models, on the changes occurring in the urban hierarchy, and on the inexorable decline of certain centres in favour of others. This article sets out to analyse the diffusion of innovative, modern and out-of-the-ordinary activities and their business networks between 1997 and 2004. It shows that the spatial diffusion observed is coherent with a hierarchical pattern on national scale, while on regional scale it is proximity that has the greatest influence. Further to this, the city of Sousse appears to be strengthening its position in relation to the second city, Sfax, while the coastal zone continues to be favoured by these processes, prefiguring the Tunisia of tomorrow.

AB  - Classical morphometric indexes have been the first quantitative methods created by geomorphologists to compare the morphometric characteristics of many catchments and to quantify their theoretical hydrologic behaviour. Even if many indices still remain quoted in numerous hydrologic books, a few authors have recently underlined the drawbacks of such methods. They are mainly static and not synthetics, and so, they are not sufficient to predict the hydrological response. So we choose creating relevant indexes basing our approach on new distributed simulation tools as cellular automata (RuiCells) to calculate synthetic indexes based on numerical experiences. Simulations on 422 varied catchments lead a few interesting results. Some efficient spatial configurations are detected at a local scale while at the global scale such behaviour was not observed. An index of spatial efficiency is proposed on each cell in order to quantify the efficiency of the network structure in every point within the catchment. The greater values identify the points with the stronger theoretical response.

AB  - Les feux de brousse constituent un phénomène particulièrement complexe, situé à l’interface nature/société. L’objectif de cet article est de montrer les conséquences de ces particularités en matière d’échelle et d’analyse. Une première partie fait le point sur les rapports espace/temps dans l’analyse de la distribution des feux. Une définition de “l’espace des feux” est proposée. Dans une deuxième partie, il s’agit d’examiner quelques-unes des combinaisons des facteurs de propagation du feu à différentes échelles spatio-temporelles : l’échelle globale, régionale et locale. Chaque échelle amène une nouvelle problématique qui coïncide avec une nouvelle interface nature/société. Dans une troisième partie, nous étudions le croisement des échelles d’observation pour mieux appréhender le phénomène des feux, dont la complexité ne réside pas seulement dans la multitude de ses composantes et de leurs interactions mais aussi dans l’imbrication de plusieurs niveaux spatiaux. Il ressort que les relations inter échelles révèlent l’opposition entre l’échelle ou la temporalité du processus biophysique et l’échelle ou la temporalité de son effet. La complexité du phénomène des feux de brousse contraint à dépasser les modèles d’observation habituels de chaque discipline, à hiérarchiser les facteurs, et à analyser les interférences spatiales et temporelles entre les facteurs naturels et les facteurs anthropiques. Bushfires constitute a particularly complex phenomenon, because they are situated at the nature/society interface. The objective of this article is to show the consequences of these peculiarities as regards scale and analysis. A first part reviews connections between space and time in the analysis of the bushfires distribution. A definition of "the space of fires" is proposed. In the second part, we consider some of the combinations of the fires distribution factors at several spatiotemporal scales : the global, regional and local scale. Every scale brings a new set of problems which coincides with a new nature/society interface. In a third part, we study the crossing of observation scales. Indeed, the phenomenon’s complexity does not lie only in its many components and their interactions but also in the overlapping of several scales. It results that bushfires are a good example for showing the opposition between the scale or the temporality of the biophysical process and the scale or temporality of its effect. The usual models of observation used in each discipline are insufficient to analyze the phenomenon of the bushfires in its complexity. The study of this phenomenon makes it necessary to take into account several space-time scales, to classify the factors according to scales of observation and to analyze the spatiotemporal interferences between natural factors and anthropic factors.

AB  - Since the beginning of the 2000’s, a new school in German-speaking geography arose which is named “Neue Kulturgeographie” (new cultural geography). It is mainly inspired by the poststructuralism and by the English-speaking new cultural geography. On the basis of a constructivist approach, the signification of space and spatial forms is the main focus of the Neue Kulturgeographie’s researches. An important difference between these researches, however, lies on the very different social theories they are based on: action theory, system theory, discourse theory and critical approaches are the four main theories being used in the Neue Kulturgeographie. The aim of this paper is to introduce the French-speaking geographer to the Neue Kulturgeography and its debate. The reader will surely recognize the questions and problems shared by the social and cultural French- (and also English-) speaking geographies.

AB  - Urban sprawl, and its main form of disperse city, increases the competition for land and the conversion of agricultural land. We analysed the municipal land planning policies in periurban areas in order to understand how agricultural landscape and activities were taken into account in such policies. In a medium town of the Midi-Pyrénées region, Albi, we characterised the periurban dynamics in terms of demography and landscape changes. We then interviewed mayors and one public servant of the land planning service of twelve municipalities of the urban and periurban area. As a result, we identified four qualifications of agricultural activities : as a disappearing land use, as a land occupation useful for the urban land management, as a producer of urban open spaces, and as an economic activity. We then discuss the implication of these results in terms of periurban farms multifunctionality.

AB  - The general aim of the study is to verify if and at what extent economic changes at global level influence territorial organisation, in terms of organisational models of the productive system and of firms location choices. The general lack of studies in this direction, due mainly to insufficient systematic information and to the specific features of many local territorial systems, led us to build a methodology aimed to increase the level of knowledge on these issues. In particular we worked on theoretical aspects, concerning both new models of territorial organisation, such as the network paradigm, and changes of the productive systems due to economic globalisation, such as the internationalisation; and empirical aspects, by analysing the productive systems of two Italian regions (Lazio and Abruzzo), which have been less analysed then other regions, but showed in recent years relevant changes, mainly concerning Small and Medium Firms and the formation of local productive systems able to ensure the adjustment to changing economic conditions. In order to analyse these two case studies, we chose to carry out a direct survey, based on a questionnaire direct to a sample of firms. The choice of data sources was not quite wide, because the new "privacy" law strongly limited the use of many data sources, so that we try to extract as many data as possible from available sources (data bases of Central Institute of Statistic and Italian Changes Office), and we construct some indicators in order : – to provide an adequate knowledge of the case studies, – to allow the simplification of the universe and to extract the sample, At the end we construct the questionnaire aimed to : – verify the general characteristics of firms and of their markets, and the level of external relations and the type of relations in which them are involved, – individuate and to evaluate the location factors' relevance.

AB  - This paper is based on the analysis of sea-surge variations in the Gulf of Lions. A sea surge is defined as the difference between the observed sea level and the astronomical tide. It corresponds to the sea-level height only forced by meteorological conditions. The main goal of our study is to analyse broad-scale climatic conditions linked to the regional and local-scale sea-surges formation in the Golfe du Lion. Around this gulf, daily variations of sea-surge heights are mostly linked with the sea-level pressure variation over the Bay of Biscay. Surge peaks almost always occured during “Greenland Above” and “Blocking” Weather Regimes. These weather regimes are potentially associated with local meteorological conditions enable to lead to a surge peak.

AB  - The need to integrate individual movements of species and their different dispersions is becoming urgent in biodiversity conservation, especially in our countries more and more fragmented. The conclusions of the recent “Grenelle de l’Environnement” in France have joined the previous results in landscape ecology research that analyses relationships between species dispersion and structures of geographic areas. One of the difficulties is the choice of a method able to traduce the green and blue network in useful maps, especially at a regional level. We propose here a simple and rapid method of assessment of potential biodiversity based on weight given by experts to different landscape occupations of a database. The approach is tested on the “Mode d’Occupation du Sol” database (scale of 1/5 000) of Île-de-France region. Identification of habitats and their potential biodiversity permit to characterise roughly but quickly the biodiversity of territories and to identify the potential green and blue networks. Maps obtained here show interesting way for the beginning of discussion about biodiversity and we suggest that this kind of precise map has to be promoted in each region.

AB  - The map of Quebec show a vast peninsula of more than 1,6 million km2. However, the northern territories, successively called Ungava, New Quebec and North-of-Quebec, belong to that canadian province since 1912. From a Quebecer point of view, the process of integration of these vast spaces sparsely inhabited by Inuit and First nation people was carried out late in history. Besides, the economic cycles related to the mining industry seem to affect deeply the development of these northern regions. Thus, stagnation and decline succeed to periods of massive investments, which bring the installation of large facilities, megastructures and some human settlements. Fermont is one of these towns affected by economic cycles. That unique town was designed by the architect-planner Norbert Schoenauer, in 1972. It expresses a desire to adapt northern settlements to the cold climates. This paper aims at taking stock of this frontier town, forthy years after its creation. We will address the issue of long-term development and resiliency of isolated mining communities in the context of the Quebec government renewed interest toward northern territories.

AB  - The agrarian sector has been strongly affected during the last few decades due to the liberalization of markets and the decrease in State intervention. In the case of the cultivation of sugar cane and the sugar agro-industry that have been strongly affected by these changes, different strategies have been adopted, varying from one region to another. In this research, we will study the case of Los Reyes Valley in the State of Michoacán, in which the cultivation of sugar cane has been continuous since Colonial times. However, in the nineties, the export crops of blackberry have gained terrain progressively at the expense of sugar cane, and this has caused multiple economic and social changes as well as changes in the landscapes. We will study the impact of the cultivation of blackberries in the valley and the resiliency of sugar cane in view of this new production, profitable but surely ephemeral.

AB  - Fuzzy difference operators are used in different fields of decision making processes, image analysis and computer vision applications. Change detection in a spatial scene is the basic issue in modeling relative motion between object pair. Many approaches are adopted to change detection in a spatial scene and change in spatial relations is one of them. Separate methodologies are adapted to determine the change in topological, directional and distance relations. In this paper, a methodology for detection of a spatial change based on fuzzy matrix calculus is presented. Difference of combined fuzzy topological and directional relations matrices is determined by fuzzy difference operators. Experiments are performed to validate the proposed method and the promising results are obtained.

AB  - Dengue is a tropical and sub-tropical disease whose etiological agent is a virus (the dengue virus, DENV). The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. The major mosquito vector is Aedes aegypti which has adapted to urban conditions; Aedes albopictus is a secondary vector, occurring in more rural environments, but which has recently invaded Europe. Currently, an estimated 70-500 million people are affected by the virus every year in over a hundred countries across the world (DVI, 2010), mainly in urban areas. In the lack of an efficient vaccine (Sabchareon et al., 2011), an effective vector control by eliminating adult mosquitoes and removing potential egg laying sites, is the only way of checking the spread of the virus once there has been an outbreak of the disease in a given territory. However, the analysis realized in intra-urban areas does not clearly show a correlation between incidence and environment. This article’s aims at understanding the spatio-temporal diffusion of registered dengue cases in Delhi in 2008 and 2009. Ultimately, the objective is to understand the factor that will impact the geography of dengue.

AB  - These last years, agent-based simulation has shown its interest for geography. However, if nowadays there are many platforms allowing the development of models, these ones are often too complex to be used by non-computer scientist (e.g. Repast Symphony) or too limited to develop rich models integrating numerous agents and data (e.g. Netlogo). The GAMA platform aims at providing modelers a complete platform that is at the same time very simple to use (thanks to a dedicated modeling language) and powerful. In this article, we present the advanced capabilities of the last version of GAMA concerning the management of space. Indeed, GAMA allows to simultaneously manage several environments based on three types of topology (continuous, grid, graph), to easily integrate geographic data (vector and raster) and to represent geometries in a 3D environment. All the capabilities detailed in this article are illustrated by a model on urban segregation.

AB  - This essay offers a reflection on the historical trajectories of two prototypical metropolises of the Western Modern world : Mexico was perceived during the 16th and 17th centuries as a laboratory for the New World urbanization and as a materialized model of a ideal city ; Los Angeles has been represented since the beginning on the 20th century as featuring the future of urban civilization in the USA and abroad. But both had also suffered a negative imagery as examples of the failure of the progressive modernist project. The comparison between the two metropolises is analyzed through the relationship, unstable through time, that can be established between Modernism, cosmopolitanism and catastrophism.

AB  - The Eurovision Song Contest is being held every year since 1956. The originality of this contest lies in the points awarding system. There is no single jury but, on the contrary, each country is asked to award a given number of points to the countries which performed its favourite songs. Beyond the interest of such a system to collectively rank countries, it provides a long story of the swapped points between countries. Such information makes it possible to detect couples of countries {voter, performer} for whom votes are not exclusively guided by song quality. Currently the media covering the event regularly mention a bias in the votes distribution: according to them, this bias would be caused by geographical proximity and would lead to blocs of nearby countries which overwhelmingly vote for each other. In this article, we try to discuss this assumption. This latter requires to answer the following question: “how can we assess the influence of spatial proximity on the social ties formation?”. Besides this issue, several methodological challenges appear. First, we examine the votes of the 1993-2008 period and we identify the social ties of interest, that is the couples of countries {voter, performer} whose votes significantly diverge from the reference situation (i.e. a competition on song quality). Then, we compare the resulting social network with the spatial countries network by a well-suited statistical method to prove that “over-votes” concern nearby countries. Finally, we highlight clusters of countries tending to over-vote for each other and, in that respect, we define clustering criteria which make sense. We show that these blocs strongly structure the abnormally high votes of the 2009 event. This analysis method combines geographical and social networks and can be extended to the study of phenomena concerning relations between spatialised entities.

AB  - From an ontological point of view, the existence of a word is the evidence for the necessity of an underlying cognitive concept. We will discuss the notion of connexity through three different words. The etymology of border, frontier and limit leads to attach to them different models of let's say ''separation'' : respectively the boundary belongs to only one object, is shared by both or belongs to none (hence is an object by itself).We compare this approach to several axiomatic (mereological) definitions of connexity : weak connexity, fiat and bona fide boundaries. The target application is a study on urban development and metropolisation shapes observed through remote sensing. The boundaries detected from multi- level texture images could be classified into several types which may be interpreted as different dynamic behaviour (hence geographical fragility or resistance).

AB  - The separation between residential and activity places is used to produce functionnal zoning such as " urban areas " or " employment areas ". Commuting and shopping trips reveal an increasing jobs, shops and services’ concentration in urban places and a large residential spreading around them. This study tries to replace interurban trips in different space categories (like urban or rural categories) by looking for the way differents grounds can be associated during a whole sequence. The main hypothesis is the existence of major trips generators (like working) relied to a number of secondary grounds (like shops or services). The main statistical source used is the Enquête Transports - Communications INRETS / INSEE 1993-1994 paired with datas from Population Census and Communal Inventory.

AB  - This study investigates the processes of growth and development of retail locations in urban space. The formation and development of multiple business centers is part of the contemporary urban landscape, creating heterogeneous spatial and temporal patterns which defy the understanding of urban theorists and planners. The study of these processes requires dynamic approaches, consistent with the scale and pace of such changes. This paper presents a proposal for the model of growth dynamic of commercial locations in urban areas over time. It also proposes the adaptation of a logistic model, a nonlinear dynamic model originated in studies of population ecology, which is used to describe growth dynamic in environments with a limited capacity. In this study, the growth of retail locations is represented by the variation in the amount of retail establishments over time in specific urban sectors. In order to develop a preliminary empirical validation of the model, its application is developed in four areas in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil, considering data on the number of shops during 23 years, from 1983 to 2006. The investigation showed a good fit of the model to empirical data in all studied areas.

AB  - The paper considers the potential pitfalls of transforming and synthesising social-economic and behavioural-attitudinal datasets across multiple levels of aggregation, with respect to geodemographic Information Systems (GDIS) and the formation of areal profiles. These pitfalls are associated with the ecological fallacy - the inappropriate ascription of the characteristics of areal data to individuals and point locations within those areas - and suggest that intimate claims to 'know' individual consumers, as propounded through some GDIS advertising, are hyperbolic. It is queried whether the infusion of lifestyles or consumer data such as the Target Group Index (a UK survey of product consumption and media preferences) to the (UK) census-based geodemographic clusters will give rise to areal profiles which are representative of the (consumer-) behaviours of individuals, suggesting where this infusion may prove to be problematic.

AB  - Unlike other contemporary productions, mono-scalar, but ethnocentric (Levasseur), or cosmopolitan (Reclus), or multi-scalar with interlocking levels of scales (Geddes), Vidal de la Blanche’s Atlas has a structure that is complex, multi-scalar and polymorphous, because it makes use of ‘referential spaces’ that differ from one plate to another. This structure was possible because of an iconographic and textual assemblage based on a composite unity, the Atlas plate forming a composition that has become canonical: maps, insets, caption. The study of the whole of the iconographic system and the textual apparatus reveals that the work is multi-scalar in two ways: first of all because, in conformity with the Vidalian epistemology, each region of the world possesses its own referential spaces, which give it its specific dimension, and on the other hand, because the Earth is in principle the ultimate unit of reference, the all-inclusive meta-scale. This meta-scale in fact includes three separate ‘worlds’, economic, imperial and civilisational, forming three intermediate meta-scales. Beyond the concern for universality, the metropolises of one or the other of these worlds (France and Europe) remain central in this representational system.

AB  - Xynthia storm that swept France on 27 and 28 February 2010, resulted in embankment failures or submersions causing flooding of coastal areas reclaimed from the sea over time and today agricultural or urbanized. This catastrophic event raises the question of the management of flood risk in France, its effectiveness and limitations. Protection, embodied by the construction of dykes, is an old solution on coasts and along the rivers. Nevertheless, this solution does not go without problems and questions about its effectiveness. Thus, new preventive responses, aiming to “do the part of the water” are starting to be implemented. Prevention, whose central element is the control of land use, is itself often difficult to implement as local resistance is strong.

AB  - The objective is to identify places of spatial concentration of road accidents by black zones rather than black points. The application of a geographical analysis method based on local measures of spatial autocorrelation permits to localise black zones. The relevance of the method is considered and a sensibility study of the results is proposed. The application of the method to an example of road shows its appropriation to the problem of black zones identification.

AB  - Japan is a field of study and education in Senegal. But the representations that are constructed on it generally work as a mirror in inverted images. In geography classes, the Senegalese are, from any point of view, opposed to the Japanese. Japan is seen as a perfect model of economic success and socio-cultural example which has come over her poor natural resources and the hard aftereffects of World War II thanks to the discipline and the work of her people. So, our relation to Japan is both mimicry and self- criticism. Japan as a field of study at school is expressed through a reductive discourse which fundamentally originates in the mass media and in Western studies – to note French ones from 1990 to 2000. It looks like a pompous lecture somehow caricatured which ranges far from Japan social and geographical current real life.

AB  - This paper shows the advantage of NOAA-AVHRR satellite data for land-sea breeze study and for spatial organisation of the urban heat island at Sfax. This data is used to characterize daily variation of heat contrasts between land and sea and the location of sea-breeze front. The impact of sea breeze penetration on air temperature in space is evaluated by coloured compositions analysis in three thermal channels. In order to study urban island heat,NOAA–AVHRR satellite images is used to characterize thermal urban-rural differences and to identify the morphology of the thermographic phenomenon. The results of satellite data, confirm the air temperature measured in the town.

AB  - Despite its enduring fundamental relationships with space in contemporary societies, geographers have rarely concerned themselves with the family. This article seeks to demonstrate the relevance of a geographical study of family by focusing on the case of Southern Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece), and by developing two related approaches to the subject. The first treats the family as a domestic group. Processes of family formation and the makeup of households in Southern Europe – strongly institutionalized marriage, low fertility rates, delayed departure from the parental home, etc. – remain very different from those in Northern and Central European countries. These persisting peculiarities call into question the theory of a geographical convergence of European family structures. The second approach focuses on residential patterns of Kinship. Southern Europe strong families are localized, and high geographical proximity between parents and children has relevant consequences on mobility patterns and urban structures. In conclusion, it is argued that the persistance of this Southern European family model can be traced to a peculiar division of labour between the State, the Family and the Market that allowed southern European countries to cope with a rapid process of urbanisation during the latter half of the twentieth century

AB  - A fashionable concept, resilience is now a must in both academic research and management. However, its polysemy nourishes many debates on its uses, heuristics and operational relevance. The purpose of this article is not to bring these debates to a close. Starting from a cross-disciplinary state of the art, we point out the incompatibilities between certain meanings and uses of the term. These inconsistencies raise theoretical issues, leading some researchers to reject the term for that matter, especially those outside the cindynics field. The analysis of the concept also brings out some methodological pitfalls. These are evident when attempting to translate theory into operational terms. Resilience is indeed seen as a promising response to recurrent difficulties in risk management. Nevertheless, it solves them only partially and produces new ones. Lastly, its implementation involves ethical and political risks. The injunction to resilience that seems to prevail internationally is in fact implying a number of moral and ideological assumptions which are not always clearly stated and remain serious issues.

AB  - Since the end of the 1980s, the commune of San Juan de la Costa (province of Osorno – 10th region of Los Lagos), is experiencing a remarkable expansion of pine and eucalyptus plantations. These afforestation are at the roots of many environmental and social disturbances in an area considered as a hotspot for biodiversity. If the Land Use and Land Cover Change (LUCC) processes are widely known, the native forests areas likely to be converted into industrial plantations remain unknown. The following article focuses on the spatial validation of two simulation models in order to suggest prospective interpretations based on a supervised approach (Markov chain coupled with a multi-criteria evaluation) and an automatic approach (multilayer neural network). Both models are built on the knowledge of past dynamics thanks to the diachronic analysis of three satellite images LANDSAT (1986-1999-2008).

AB  - <r2r:ml lang="ru"><p class="resumeru" dir="ltr">The conceptual and methodological framework of modern medical geography began in 1950s with the publication of the paper by J.M. May entitled: « Medical Geography: Its Methods and Objectives », in 1950 in <em>The Geographical Review</em>. Almost all writers in medical geography followed the paradigm of Geogens and Pathogens, as was laid down by May, though some scholars are of the opinion that much medical geography now views J.M. May as a historical curiosity. An attempt has been made in this paper to discuss the contributions of J.M. May and Maximilien Sorre, and highlights the fact that it was M. Sorre and not J.M. May, who propounded the concept of pathogenic complexes in 1933 - seventeen years before J.M. May published his paper. Sorre's pathogenic complexes incorporated physical, biological and anthropological factors. Sorre was the first academic geographer of the twentieth century (after F. Ratzel of Germany), who incorporated biological contents in geography in general and medical geography in particular. He is also credited with developing relations of geography with medicine as well as sociology. The paper examines the contribution of M. Sorre in medical geography, with special reference to pathogenic complexes and finaly J.M. May and the American Geographical Society. The evidences cited in the paper prove that J.M. May borrowed the fundamental concept of geogens and pathogens, from the 1933 paper published by M. Sorre without citing the reference of Sorre's pioneering research of 1933.</p><p class="resumeru" dir="ltr">Le cadre conceptuel et méthodologique de la géographie médicale moderne s'est forgé dans les années 50 avec la publication d'un article de J.M. May : &quot;La géographie médicale : ses méthodes et ses objectifs&quot;.

AB  - In France, the strong storms of the last decades and their impacts on coasts led to emphasize the relationships which may exist between the climate change and coastal erosion and flooding. It seems however necessary to consider the contemporaneous geomorphological dynamics of the coasts in the context of their evolution depending upon various factors such as the Flandrian transgression, the marine and climate weather, the sedimentary budget and human impacts. Some examples of coastal evolution in Brittany allow to remind that the shoreline mobility results from processes acting at various scales of time and space. In that context, the predictable impacts of the climate change could act as an aggravating factor in an already very unfavorable situation reinforced by the stakes growth.

AB  - Agricultural practices and their evolution play a key role on land use and environmental ecosystem change. Environmental studies have showed the importance of landscape structure element composition and spatial arrangement to maintain the agricultural landscape multifunctionality. Two of these elements were analyzed in this study: parcels, in analyzing crop rotation; and hedgerows by their physiognomy and continuity in the landscape. The two elements, parcels and hedgerows, had been put together in order to analyze the hedgerow spatial arrangement (continuity type) according to the land cover spatial dynamic (crop rotation) in their neighborhood. Results highlight a general spatial logic as densest hedgerows are concentrated within grassland parcel groups, while narrowest are border by more intensive parcels, i.e. always or predominantly in crop. However, results have also showed that landscape type influence the structure of landscape patterns: in case of opening landscapes, hedgerow network is indifferently bordered by crops or grassland parcels; associated agricultural practices for the management of this hedgerows are fundamentally different.

AB  - The aim of this paper is about the trends of regional disparities in the European Union who can be considered as a complex system.. For modelling the uncertain efficiency of the regional policy we attempted to use a cellular automata (Geocells) developed by P.Langlois). Methodologically, this cellular automata Geocells is based on interrelated processes between variables (like time periods, growth rates in the GDP per head, flows of public investments) and three geographical levels (european level, national level and regional level). This three levels are used to lay the emphasis on the fact that the EU structural expenditure, and its spatial impact, work as a rules-based system. Simulations were made, in order to evaluate, on the one hand, the specific role of each level and each variable, and on the other hand how some change in one part affects the whole. In this perspective we could underline the role of increasing or decreasing budgets, the weigth of national policies and national economic trends and the contiguity effect according to the geographical location of each eligible region.

AB  - Mexico City's urban development, oriented to car infrastructure, has contributed to the degradation of public spaces and neighborhood segregation, making walking difficult and limiting people's access to the city's resources. In this context, pedestrians have developed a particular behavior to navigate public spaces and bypass the norm, which has led them to be qualified as "irresponsible". This behavior adopted by pedestrians tells us about the spatial configuration of the city, the quality of public spaces and the nature of both urban planning and road safety policies. The pedestrian is the product of an environment that denies the existence of the flâneur and requires constant adaptations from those on foot. In this paper, we seek to establish a dialogue between the image of the flâneur and the pedestrian's practices in Mexico City, underlining the gap between the ideal definition of the former and the daily reality of the latter. Whereas the flâneur embodies a city that enables social and sensorial relationships, the pedestrian is an expression of the denial of the right to the city.

AB  - We propose the following method for evaluating road network patterns. An evaluation of these patterns is important not only for an understanding of the structure of a city, but also for compliance with the rule in the Building Standards Law (the basic law related to buildings and cities in Japan), that makes it possible to preserve lanes (i.e., narrow roads less than four meters wide). This rule, however, does not provide a method for judging whether or not road network patterns are laid out in a suitable manner. We conducted an interview at a local administrative office and found that this provision is closely related to the need to ensure access for fire-fighting equipment and personnel. Thus, by determining whether, in an area encircled by wide roads, there is a ‘fire-inextinguishable area’ (FIA) more than 140 meters from the nearest wide roads (i.e., an area where fires cannot be put out effectively), we can determine whether or not road networks are appropriately laid out. In addition, we present a mathematical formula showing that if there is no ‘fire-inextinguishable area’ (FIA) in an encircled area, there will not be an unsuitable, blocked position for putting out fires. Observing this difference, as well as the ease in turning right or left at intersections in the areas encircled by wide roads, we found that grid road network patterns are appropriately set up. Also, by using indices based on graph theory as a complementary method for evaluating road network patterns, we found that while almost all narrow road networks are classified as belonging to the tree pattern, some of these narrow networks are considered to be almost in the grid pattern, and are directly connected to wide roads. This indicates that actual road networks in Tokyo have weak connectivity, which may cause difficulties in ensuring two-way escape.

This approach combines scenarios about change in LandUse, LandCover and territorial foresight in the context of a participatory workshop. The scenarios are built by using modeling and simulation tools. Maps of potential land use in 2030 are produced and discussed in the workshop. After a review of territorial foresight and geoprospective concepts, we detail the organization of the workshop, the elaboration of the simulation models and the results of the project. Then, we address the question of interest and limits of using LULC modeling and simulation techniques in a territorial prospective, relying on the remarks of participants and our own observations.

AB  - In the mountainous islands of Lesser Antilles, the climatic gradients, providing from the geomorphological patterns identify, nevertheless, a complex vegetal building, clearly noticeable throughout the physionomies and within the landscapes expressed by the great floristic unities, as well. Those latter, from the coast up to the higher peaks, anywhere sylvatic ecosystems are able to grow, are potential : tropical season, sempervirente in the average and lower levels. Tropical , submountainous and tropical mountains ombrophile in the upper levels. The lower levels, where the population settled and developped the first great plantations, suffer from an important ecosystemic degradation. The initial equilibrium being annihilated because of anthropization, within this dry bioclimate area, the regression process led to the rise of an (mainly littoral) inconstant and dry vegetation, essentially constituated by grass, shrub and pre-sylvatic phytocenoses; the forest caracteristic units are rare, secondary and present a weak biodiversity. However, within the littoral areas of this archipelago system, very organized or sub-climatic unities looking like the primitive referents, can be observed. The conclusion of studies upon those relic vegetation entities allowed primary a reconstitution of the vegetal carpet of the pre-comumbian littoral, secondary an understanding appreciation of the various and successionnal modalities, and thirdly the associated factorial constraints.

AB  - This research has evaluated the interface of society-space-resources dynamics in the Massif of the Fouta-Djalon from a perspective of sustainable environmental and territorial decision taking. It combines remote sensing and systemic modelization to analyse the dynamics of the territorial system. From the treatment of Landsat satellite images from 1975, 1985, and 2006, the retrospective land occupation of 31 years is characterized. It shows an expansion of the inhabited and agro pastoral territory against the forestry one. The universe of possible future of the socio-ecological system of the massif was analysed over 150 years through three scenarios. The scenarios are “constant value”, “fluctuation mini-max” and “continued annual growth” Those scenarios showed that the territorial system of the future is worrying from the ecological perspective and also from the social stability perspective. After the analyse of these scenarios, the best future perspective of the territorial system is presented in the “sustainable acceptable” scenario or durability model. An implementation scheme accompanies this model of integrated and sustainable administration of territory and environment.

AB  - Emerging applications such as cartography and multi-representation require new data modelling concepts to take into account specific characteristics of geographical data such as multi representation and dynamic spatial objects. This paper presents a multi-layered functional data model that allows the specification of geographic data at two levels: generic and domain. The generic level defines general spatial concepts that are common to different applications. The domain level specializes the general special concepts to model specific characteristics of different applications. We use the concept of role to define the semantics and structural links among different geographical data representations. The proposed model is illustrated by an urban application example.

AB  - This paper explores whether gender-based commuting gaps change in Sweden in times when policies at various levels seek to promote both spatially extended labour markets and gender equality. We use Swedish national travel survey data from 1994–1995 and 2005–2006 to explore inequality in terms of distance, time use, speed, and car use. Special attention is paid to the urban regions of Malmö and Göteborg, as they display large and diverging changes over time. Results indicate that both women and men in Sweden increased daily commuting distance over the period, and that the gender gap slightly decreased. Both women and men spent more time commuting than using faster transport systems to extend their labour market access. Women still commute by slower means of transport than do men, and this did not change substantially. At the regional level, average commuting distances for women and men converged in the Malmö region, in contrast to increased divergence in the Göteborg region. Convergence in Malmö was mainly associated with women extending their daily travel, while divergence in Göteborg depended on men extending theirs. Changed access to cars does not seem to be the main explanation of the observed difference in commuting distance between women and men in the two regions indicating that gender-related changes are largely contingent on region-specific factors.

AB  - Territories are increasingly interdependent. In this context, technical networks affect directly the well-being of the people and the smooth functioning of societies. So, in a risk context, it seems relevant to study strengths and weaknesses of technical networks. To this end, several approaches can be applied. However, for different reasons, structural analysis, which study technical networks pattern, are increasingly used. Risk studies do not escape this trend. Nevertheless, in current structural analyses, spatial dimension is often neglected, even though technical networks are actually spatial infrastructures. This research develops therefore methods to take this spatial dimension into account. Results highlight the criticality of peripheral components (nodes) and call into question criticality of central components. A new methodology has been therefore developed for identifying critical scenarios.

AB  - The La Tolita site appeared on the Pacific coast of northern Ecuador around 3000 BP, and its culture quickly spread throughout the interior alluvial plain of mangrove and thick rainforest vegetation up to an elevation of 2000m along the Andean slopes. New geomorphic evidence shows that the flowering of the La Tolita culture could have followed a natural disaster that opened a new waterway, which facilitated communication with gold bearing areas and Andean communities landward. The La Tolita area is located in the Esmeraldas-Tumaco seismic zone, one of the most active on earth. The channel avulsion is correlated with active fault motion in the alluvial lowlands of the Santiago and Cayapas River basins. We question here the relation between the two phenomenons’, natural disaster and cultural flowering.

The relationship between the structuration-theory on the one hand and the concept of time-geography on the other hand is discussed. It is argued for that the development in time-geography towards micro-simulation approaches opens new doors for the debate concerning the relation environment – human agency. At the end the article argues for a combined approach where migration is understood from two viewpoints; the structuration theory and the time-geography.

Turkey, whose demographic reshuffling was carried out through violence during the first part of the 20th century, sees its relative ethno-national homogeneity confronted with its maritime or continental frontier interfaces, and with people and neighbouring spaces inherited from the Ottoman Empire. Five graphic models, or chrono-chorotypes, allow to seize better, in closely associated space and time, the impact of the Turks between Europe and Asia, and the constraints and challenges which Turkey is facing in its Middle-Eastern and European environment.

This model allows the extraction of various graphs, including the functional graph of the network-time-distances between buildings, and the neighbourhood- relationships graph which represents the network-neighbourhoods according to a certain time-distance-threshold and a given transportation mode.

At the same time, the archipelago has become one of the most famous parts of the Irish work within the world library. For more than a century, particularly after the publication of John Millington Synge’s founder book in 1907, Aran has evolved as a continuous creative writing workshop, without any state cultural policy. This production of scientific and artistic works has transformed Aran and radically changed its living conditions and its position in the global space. This process having turned into a co-production by both foreigners and natives, the glocal rise of the humble Aran in the world library reminds us of other paradoxical places within the global library, such as the Lacandon forest or the pays dogon.

AB  - Segregation indices are today well known and increasingly used in urban studies. However, in the absence of specialized computer tools, calculating segregation indices soon becomes a long and complicated process. The odd free applications designed to calculate indices are implemented in geographic information systems (ArcInfo, ArcView and MapInfo). Users wishing to calculate indices by way of these applications must have the GIS software that contains the application and also a sufficient understanding of how to use geographic information systems—two conditions that can limit the use and correspondingly, broad access to residential segregation indices. To remedy this situation, we propose an independent and free application developed in C#.Net called Segregation Analyzer that allows some forty segregation indices (unigroup, intergroup, and multigroup) to be calculated quickly and easily, regardless of the data or city being studied. This application can be downloaded free of charge from the Spatial Analysis and Regional Economics Laboratory —SAREL— Web site (http://laser.ucs.inrs.ca/EN/Download.html).

AB  - The proposed principle for understanding the urban fabric is based on considering the town as a set of complex objects, taking a systemic approach. The town system used to study the urban fabric over large time spans is composed of three sub-systems relating to historical objects from the level of the excavation to that of the former urban space: function (social use), space (location, surface area and morphology) and time (dating, duration and chronology). The historical object is the analytical unit of the space studied. It is the Cartesian product of the three sets, Social use, Space and Time, from which it stems. On the basis of this process, the Historical Object (OH) is broken down into three types of simple object, functional (EF), spatial (ES) and temporal (ET). - The thematic approach to the OH in an urban environment is based on social use, organized according to a hierarchical thesaurus. - Space, the most formalized of the three sets, is structured on the model of a planar topological graph without isthmi. - Time, always considered as continuous and linear, will be modelled by analogy with space using temporal topology defined in the field of artificial intelligence. The relationships between these three sets each characterize an interaction (social use-space, social use-time, time-space, or function-space-time). In addition to reconstructing the OH, they allow urban changes to be observed by analyzing the distributions and mapping of each of the entities singly or two-by-two. The originality of this procedure lies in its approach whereby it is possible to start not from the mapping of a phenomenon at a time t1 and comparing it to that at a time t2, but to look at it in the same way whether its input is social use, space or time. The heuristic value of this modelling lies in the shift from description (what, where, when) to understanding the phenomena of change (how, why).

AB  - The object of this research was the study of those places in which exchanges and transactions take place not only between immigrants and the indigenous population, but also between the different ethnic immigrant groups within the Lausanne agglomeration. The study also examined the context in which these places emerged, their history and the discourses which constitute their apologies. This approach allows us to understand the nature of these places, of their role within the urban environment and of the different types of relationships which can be created. It permits us to do this by placing the emphasis on the representations that are made of them, on the construction of sense and the way in which space is structured. Our interest in these "hybrid places" stems from the notion that immigration in urban centres promotes a "culture of mixedness" which in itself represents the central issue in the whole question of cohabitation between and integration of different populations at the urban scale. The focus is on the attempt to understand the significance of these hybrid places in the eyes of those actors who use them, or pass judgement on them. The ethno-methodological approach is that of participating observation, the recording and interpretation of interactions as well as unstructured interviews, with that aim to ascertain the details of integration and segregation processes.

AB  - Currently, in Madagascar, GIS maps are being increasingly produced and used by non-governmental organizations, regarding conservation local contracts. These maps are used by policy makers to determine forest enclosures and to support local development. However, farmers are poorly involved in the map building process and have difficulty to link the maps to their territory. Thus, the goal of our research work is to know how to build a map that everyone could understand. We therefore rely on an empirical approach, based on the methods of participative cartography. First we want to know how each farmer draws his territory on a blank sheet of paper, and comments his drawing, and second how he does read and correct graphical diagrams, maps, aerial photos and satellite images of this territory. The aim is twofold, first, understanding how maps are viewed by farmers, and second, building a methodological approach to gather the points of view expressed in individual maps drawn by farmers on the same territory. Empirical observations from this survey are presented and discussed, focusing on how Madagascar peasants represent their territory.

AB  - This study is carried out on the state of the Saloum estuary’s mangrove ecosystems, from 1972 to 2010, a period characterized by a climatic variability (drought) in West Africa. It is based on diachronic analysis of Landsat and SPOT satellite images (from 1972 to 1986, from 1986 to 2001 and from 2001 to 2010). Results show a negative overall evolution of the Saloum estuary’s mangrove at the rate of 34.8% characterized by a significant disappearance of the mangrove (38.3%) concentrated in the north-western periphery of the estuary and a very weak extension (3.5%) from 1972 to 1986. Between 1986 and 2001, one notices a relative stability (89.4%) but marked by a regeneration of the mangrove (14.38%) compared to a weaker regression (10.64%). From 2001, mangrove evolution remains weak (18.96%) but characterized by a drop of the disappearance (4.36%) with an increase of the regeneration (23.31%). The rainfall was found to be the main factor of the mangrove dynamics in the Saloum estuary. As well, efforts done by setting up the mangrove protection and development projects allowed a good awareness of local populations on the necessity to take into account the mangrove degradation level and the urgency to safeguard this ecosystem.

This article examines how the revolution of Egyptian tourism has led to the development of previously desert areas – the shores of the Red Sea and of the Mediterranean Sea – in an inversion of the previously Nile Valley-centred tourism maps. It shows that those new tourism territories are produced by a combination of processes acting on different geographical scales, from the local to the global. The article examines in particular the combined role of four players: the tourist, the state, the local entrepreneur, and the global tourism industry.

AB  - This article uses viewshed analysis to study the relationships between different islands in the Archipelago of the Azores, in the context of a geographical analysis of the distribution of populations.  The issue is whether “to see” or “to be seen” is a relevant factor influencing the choice of zones of habitation in the specific setting of the Archipelago of the Azores.  The literature often focuses on the relationships of covisibility maintained between the different islands.  Using an analytical method based on an algorithm of covisibility, we propose a quantification of these connections using a method based on a viewshed algorithm. The computing of viewshed algorithms is time-consuming. To overcome this problem, we propose in the first section a method of computing time based on the reduction of the number and the optimization of the placement of the viewpoints used for the calculation.  The results show a significant drop in computing time.  A second section of the paper presents a method of spatial analysis that makes it possible to determine and to quantify the grouping of inhabitants that can be seen from one island to another.  The results are then analysed, and a chart is drawn up, and the chart is then discussed in a final section.  Contributions to the study are on two levels.  The first is related to the methodology, and is described before the second one.  The second one, more geographical, points to the viewshed factor:  of course the viewshed factor on its own does not explain the distribution of populations, but it sheds new light on the question.  It also facilitates an understanding of the complex relationships that motivate these islands, in the very contemporary perspective of a reflection on new planning issues in the Azores Archipelago.

AB  - This paper explores the role of agricultural policies on the ricefield area dynamic in the Camargue, a Mediterranean wetland of international importance for waterbird conservation. Rice is the most common crop in the Rhone delta and earlier studies have highlighted the strong complementarity of rice fields with natural habitats for waterbirds. Modifications of agriculture-environment interactions are tackled through two main bird groups, of conservation interest, using ricefields for feeding purposes: colonial herons and flamingos. The regional history, concerning land-use and rice-farming changes, reveals the ways in which the local landscape has changed as the national and supranational agricultural policies have developed since WWII. The importance of the increase of ricefield area for colonial herons as well as the role of ricefield landscape modifications on the crop damages by flamingos are examined. They illustrate how wildlife and farming interact in a complex manner, which needs to be understood in order to develop agricultural practices adapted to the environment and to promote integrated environmental policies. The authors suggest that a better understanding of the role which agricultural policies play on a region’s development history and geography is fundamental to any conservation policy analysis.

Two contradictory purposes are co-existing. The will to transform Moscow into an international pole (ambitious aspect of this policy) and the wish to "re-russificate" the image of the capital (nostalgic aspect). The power seeks for its roots and pays a lot of attention to the projects of renovation.

AB  - In the extreme southeast of France the Alpes-Maritimes are regularly touched by ozone pollution. Pollutant emissions due to human activities and to certain natural sources are responsible for it in weather conditions convenient to their bad dispersal. This photochemical said pollution is numerically feigned by determinist models with diverse spatial scales: they take into account atmosphere chemistry and transport of pollutants. Excessively complex these tools allow to inform the citizens the day before or two days before about the air quality whom they are going to inhale. These models thus perform a preventive mission because certain decisions will be taken in case of peaks pollution forecast. This article aims to estimate the reliability of the AIRES platform, a local application of the PREV’AIR model which models the atmospheric pollution on a European scale. This validation is established by the confrontation of the model outputs with the data measured on the ground during very numerous itinerant ozone measurements campaigns.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to better identify the decisive factors of the daily mobility by bus in urban areas. We try in particular to study to what extent the quality of the transportation supply by bus determines its use. In a first step we develop an indicator which describes locally the quality of the transportation supply by bus. In a second step, original data concerning moving practices have been collected through a telephone survey and implemented in a Geographical Information System. In a third step, the comparison between bus supply and its use shows that, if the quality of the bus supply determines the use only at an aggregate level, it is on the other hand strongly related to the level of satisfaction for the use of bus. Rather than through a global estimation of the bus supply, it appears that the modal choice can only be explain through the comparison of the bus and car supply for a given set of journeys.

AB  - As many other cities of the South, Bogota, the capital of Colombia, entered twenty years ago into a new phase of development, slower than the former: the peripherical expansion dynamic turned into another dynamic dominated by population redistribution in the urban area. This article aims at analysing the evolution and the transformations of the main forms of the socio-spatial configuration from 1973 to1993. For that, we set up a “multi-dates” typology in order to show the perennials structures of the socio-demographic composition of Bogota. The methodology suggested consists in defining a coherent reference area that is the set of households listed in 1973 and in 1993 and working on basic socio-demographic variables on the households that are factual recognized information. The use of typological analysis (factorial analysis and clasification) enables, under these conditions, to test and to produce strong and stable structures of the population of Bogota. This multidates analysis gives a multivariate indicator of the social composition of Bogota, which enables to adopt a global approach to study the trajectories of the districts in the social structure of the city.

AB  - On the uninhabited atoll of Clipperton, the fourth French Pacific territory, the land and lagoon ecosystems are in drastic degradation while natural hazards are severe. Since the sixties, occurred a desertification process due apparently to the elimination of pigs introduced by the end of the 19th century, and consequently to the proliferation of millions of omnivorous crabs and thousands of birds. The lack of vegetal cover was already the natural stage before human presence showing therefore a positive human impact on this exceptional environment. Considering these environmental stakes, and enlighten by economic and geopolitical issues of the region, the author proposes, after a limited planning, a land partition between a fully protected area and a human settlement sector which would guarantee French sovereignty on this zone lusted for its resources.

AB  - How far do built up areas integrate vegetation? According to income levels, do households live in more or less vegetalised districts? This paper reports a research based upon data on land use, urban fabric and sociodemographic features in the city of Paris. A data base was built, using a GIS. Three sets of paradoxical relationships were found. The first – haussmannian- paradox relies to the concentration of well off households in the least vegetalised districts. In the second paradox, gentrifiers were hypothezised to live in the most vegetalised districts: data analysis does not confirm this hypothesis. The third major findings are also counter-intuitive: retired households are living in the most vegetalized areas in Paris, wherever rich or poor. These results open up new lines of interpretation and of further research on gentrification processes, and of urban change more generally.

AB  - Over the last decade, the concept of "Stadtschrumpfung" (urban decline) has become a crucial factor in German urban studies. It covers all the negative dynamics within the demographic, economic and social aspects of urban areas and especially of the German "new Länder". This article will offer a thematic review of the concept in German academic literature. Three main themes are to be analysed: the preconditions leading to the debate on urban decline, the analysis of the factors and symptoms of decline by German researchers, and the assessment of urban policies implemented to cope with the problem. We will eventually consider the contributions of the German debate and its criticisms of the dominant growth paradigm relating to urban studies and policies.

AB  - This article investigates the challenges linked to the notion of environmental services as manifest in rural public policies in Madagascar’s forested zones. It analyses how the concept renews certain environmental politics, how it is put into practice, and how it is appropriated by the farmers. In other words, it asks what is meant by “buying and selling environmental maintenance”, what are the mechanisms for this, and what are the results in terms of the dual objectives of biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction. This study of Payments for environmental services (PES) took place in Lalangina Region, in Betsileo country on the western slope of the Ambositra-Vondrozo forest corridor (Cofav). The novelty of the PES is that it would involve payments for the forest’s natural processes through a privatization of a public good, the environment. There are a number of systems that put buyers and sellers of PES in contact. In this case, the payees are local communities. They are paid by the Small grant program of the global environmental facility (GES/SGP/UNDP) to reduce their uses of nature and to contribute in this way to environmental protection. This provision seeks to change attitudes through new income generating activities outside the forest that utilize positive practices for both environmental services and agricultural or artisanal production.

AB  - This work is an analysis of the representations of street commerce (ambulantaje) in Mexico City through its representations in the 18th Century Pintura de Castas, in photography from the late 19th Century through the beginning of the 20th Century, and in press photos from the turn of the 21st Century. This essay looks at the transformations that ambulantaje has had in the different eras of the development of Mexico City through the analysis of the producers of the images and the imaginarium of this type of commerce, through the use of the Pintura de Castas or of photographs. The three articles that make up the essay look at how ambulantaje has been represented in each era, what features of this activity have been modified and which ones have been maintained from one period to another, and how the analysis of the representations of one time period helps to understand the images propagated in the following periods. The authors examine three dimensions of the representation of ambulantaje for each period: social, territorial and economic dimensions. In spite of the different sources and analytic perspectives of each author, we can identify aspects that remain constant throughout this long time period and allow us to understand the dynamics of the social phenomenon of this type of commerce in Mexico City, within an historical, as well as traditional, framework. We conclude that ambulantaje is an activity which adapts to the changing conditions of public space, and this adaptability makes it possible to continue throughout the different eras of urban development.

AB  - This paper presents a new way to look for the "center" of a statistical distribution. This concept basically combines the mean and the median, i.e. two L-norms, to define a new metric in order to improve the robustness of efficiency of an estimator. After a short historical presentation of the relationships between the mean and the median in the quest for the "center", we explain the problematic that leads us to propose a new estimator. We define the meadian, a first version of which was set up by Laplace in the early 1800s, and present its asymptotic properties. We justify the choice of bootstrap to compute the variances involved in the meadians definition. Some applications in spatial filtering are presented and discussed. In conclusion, we comment on some further developments and perspectives for the "meadian attitude".

AB  - The economic geography of greater Paris has experienced important changes in the last 25 years. The increase in both services and high-tech jobs has obviously had consequences on the employment location. Such changes might affect the way data and statistics help to understand the region. They might not be as accurate in the end of the period as they were at the beginning. Hence the data that were available between 1975 and 1990 seemed to reveal a dramatic evolution for the eastern part of the urban area. A new analysis made on the same data but coded in a different way (thanks to a new nomenclature) tends to tell another story. Both eastern and western parts have evolved, but the former data were able to reveal only a part of the changes. And that part concerned mostly the jobs concentrated in the western part. So it missed the changes of the east.

AB  - Since the last twenty years, natural hazard have taken an important place in our mind and in the media. Considered in the pastas the manifestation of the divine's anger and of the fatality, scientist progress has brought us to a rationalization of the way of thinking, making us less tolerant with natural hazard. If many studies have been made in a frame of the characterisation of the physical process that bring to natural hazard, few studies have been made in a frame of the a global estimation of the exposition of each country to natural hazard using two approaches of the vulnerability. The aim of our paper is to present a comparative study of the estimation of the risk exposure of each country, combining two approaches of the vulnerability (social and economic) with a probabilistic approach of the hazard. This work highlights the fact that using a social approach of the vulnerability, we can observe a great inequality between "rich" countries and "poor" countries that present a high level of exposure to risk while using an economical approach of the vulnerability, "rich" countries present the highest level of exposure to risk.

AB  - Over the last twenty years, complexity issues have been a central theme of enquiry for the modelling field. Whereas contributing to both a critical revisiting of the existing methods and opening new ways of reasoning, the effectiveness (and sense) of modelling activity was rarely questioned. Acknowledgment of complexity however has been a fruitful spur new and more sophisticated methods in order to improve understanding and advance geographical sciences. However its contribution to tackle urban problems in everyday life has been rather poor and mainly limited to rhetorical claims about the potentialities of the new approach. We argue that although complexity has put the classical modelling activity in serious distress, it is disclosing new potentialities, which are still largely unnoticed. These are primarily related to what the authors has called the structural cognitive shift, which involves both the contents and role of modelling activity. This paper is a first part of a work aimed to illustrate the main features of this shift and discuss its main consequences on the modelling activity. We contend that a most relevant aspect of novelty lies in the new role of modelling as a cognitive mediator, i.e. as a kind of interface between the various components of a modelling process and the external environment to which a model application belongs.

AB  - We propose to study the emergence of kinematic waves in microscopic models of traffic flow. The vehicles motion is given by car-following differential systems that incorporate a targeted state function and a strictly positive reaction time. Through simulations, we observe two types of stationary state for a line of vehicle evolving on a ring: a homogeneous state in which vehicle speed and gap are constant and equal and a heterogeneous state in which kinematic waves spread out. The reaction time and the form of the targeted state function seem to be the determining microscopic factors of the macroscopic stationary state stability. A stability linear analysis of the homogeneous state is done with a basic car-following model. The results indicate an explicit condition between the reaction time, the form of the targeted state function and the stationary state nature of the vehicle line.

AB  - After three decades of demographic decline, Swiss cities have registered a new period of growth since 2000. One of the explanations of this trend reversal is the construction in the frame of urban regeneration projects of dwellings addressed to the middle to high classes (« new-build gentrification »). This paper focuses on the characteristics of people living in recently built dwellings in Neuchatel, a 33 000 inhabitant city. On the basis of a questionnaire survey, it adresses the characteristics of these households (profiles, trajectories, motivations). Results show a diversification of the middle to high classes whose residential aspirations are less and less oriented towards the detached house in suburbs. The results also bring more generally elements on gentrification processes in small and medium cities.

AB  - The emotions that as inhabitants we feel towards our environment suggest that we have an aesthetic relation to our territory. The formal criticism of works of art allows to extend the content of geographical discussion beyond technical considerations and to renew the understanding of the political stakes involved in our existence. Aesthetic pleasure is a way to make the space of architects and that of geographers coincide. The work of Frank Lloyd Wright may be viewed as an illustration of what such an approach can bring to territorial evaluation, all the more so as the formal research he undertook about space in domestic architecture stems from his ambitious conception of the territorial development of the United States. Far from being hostile to urbanity, Frank Lloyd Wright was throughout his career preoccupied with imagining the shape a modern city might take as a result of the free expression of its inhabitants. His visionary reflection can help us enrich our way of looking at the city-to-be.

AB  - The analysis of point event patterns has a long tradition. Of particular interest are patterns of clustering or ‘hot spots’ and such cluster detection lies at the heart of spatial data mining. Certain classes of point event patterns have a significant proportion of the data having a tendency towards exact spatial repetitiveness. Examples are crime and traffic accidents. Spatial superimposition of point events challenges many existing approaches to cluster detection. In this paper a variable resolution approach, Geo-ProZones, is applied to residential burglary data exhibiting a high level of repeat victimisation. This is coupled with robust normalisation as a means of consistently defining and visualising the ‘hot spots’.

AB  - The CORINE programme (initiated in 1985) has created an Information System referring to the European Union countries, which provides administrative, geographical, land use, vegetal cover information, along with different environmental parameters (CORINE, 1994). The CORINE land cover database offers valuable information on the different land covers of the mapped areas. At present the whole Iberian Peninsula is covered by this digitised database. CORINE is a very valuated instrument in the EU countries where it has been completed. It is therefore necessary to check the quality of the information it provides taking into account the large extension, the climate and environmental variety of the mapped surface. This paper consists of an in-depth study, based on various updated sources, of the actual state of the land cover in a specific area in the central part of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) with a surface area of approximately 10,000 sq. km. The information obtained is then compared to the CORINE data for the same area. Our aim is therefore to verify the validity of the latter in a pilot zone by using, for this purpose, databases whose definition is higher than CORINE’s and observe both its degree of updated accuracy as also the suitability of the different categories used by CORINE with the land uses and ecosystems existing today. The paper requires the choice of an appropriate scale, which depends on the nature of the study to be carried out. CORINE forms a good database for the handling of information on land cover on large working scales. The geo-referencing errors detected in the present paper have shown the difficulty of its overlapping with other databases. After the relevant comparisons, which could not be carried out by overlapping, it is proved how CORINE land covers is becoming out of date, taking into account the transformations, changes and development of the present land cover in our area. On the other hand, we consider that the nomenclature of CORINE land cover may not be sufficiently varied in its third level, especially in woodland areas. The results  in the grouping of very different formations in the same class. This does not happen, for example, in the urban areas, when a large quantity of classes exist to define the variety of  urban land uses. This study has been carried out in the setting of the Project “Modelling the effect of land degradation on climate” (ENV4-CT98-0696) financed by the European Union.

AB  - In order to translate the characteristics of geographic data into signs and signals that can be perceived from a map, a language consisting of building blocks and a syntax are required. The first language to be developed was a graphic sign language, introduced by Bertin. His framework has been adapted and extended. It now includes languages for other senses, like touch and hearing, and even smell and taste are currently being investigated. In this paper it has been argued that the overall framework is continuously growing under the influence of technological, conceptual and user-oriented developments. Technological developments in particular are rapid. For example, they allow the representation of geographic data in virtual environments, which can be experienced through multiple senses. If cartographers want to play a role here, they should be willing to contribute to further extension of the framework, which may never be complete. In addition, current definitions of the concepts 'cartography' and 'map' have to be adapted. An example of user-oriented developments is the growing awareness of different types of map use, ranging from presentation to analysis/exploration. Application of the sign language may be different for each type of use, so the framework also needs further development in this direction. As an example, research ideas with respect to the use of dynamic visualization variables in cartographic animations for exploration purposes are included.

AB  - This paper deals with the disparities of influence between port cities from the accessibility to population and wealth perspective. The location of port cities relative to trunk road routes and markets has an impact on their traffic and area of influence. There are major disparities between, and in the ranges. These disparities are quantified and analysed from a sample of 73 cities, using various accessibility indices. The resulting hierarchies give an insight of the dominance of some port cities on others that can help shape local and regional planning policies.

AB  - During the last decades, the oil-producing Arab countries of the Gulf have undergone many socioeconomics changes. It had a considerable impact on urban spaces in terms of forms, functions and structures. The traditional social structures of cities were completely changed. Consequently, a new configuration appeared, essentially determined by new economic criteria of localization. In Muscat, capital of the Sultanate of Oman, the emergence of new social relations led to a spatial mobility of the households in function of their purchasing power of building lands or houses. However, in a country where the land is publicly owned and which is sold officially at a unique and fixed price, the dynamism of a parallel land market lets foretell a segregationist division of the inhabited areas or in the currently urbanizing spaces. Therefore, the practices of production and structuring of space seem to escape the spirit of the urban policy and to contradict the will of a regulation legislated by public authority. The new configuration of the urban space seems henceforth as the product of a contradiction between the public will, the private sector and the interests of land speculators. The strategies and tactics of the urban end-product private producers are conducive to a new urban reality. Muscat city is witnessing a shift from fragmentation, tribal and even ethnic division that had prevailed until the beginning of 1970s, to a polarization and socioeconomic stratification.

AB  - The triangulo-hexagonal system of Walter Christaller (Die zentralen Orte, 1933) was the subject of sharp debates among German speaking geographers from 1933 until our days. In spite of the fact that several of them denounce the mathematical errors of Walter Christaller, his unrealistic assumptions, the non-adequacy of his model to reality or his heavy totalitarian past, one sees the hexagons appear, disappear, then reappear, like an obsession or an ideal image which haunts geographers’ thought. Even when this figure disappears, the fundamental ideas of the Christallerian system remain, all founded on the concept of “center”. Why have so many authors, coming from different scientific horizons (geography or spatial planning), political (partisans of totalitarian or democratic ideals) or national (Estonia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland), defended a system condemned since its beginnings? Some among these geographers call however with a change of paradigm since the end of the 20th century. New concepts appear, sometimes even in authors still fascinated by the hexagon, which contradict partially or completely the Christallerian system: “concentrated decentralization”, “decentral concentration”, “deconcentration” or “polycentric structure” of the urban system. All these concepts however remain close to that of centrality. In reality, all the places are at the same time central and decentral, both being indissociably dependant.

AB  - Reading is a common living experience ; it is source of dualism : travel through a linear oriented structure as well as graphe's projection on an imaginary screen. It is mostly automatic, underconscious. The reader's pleasure rises in this consciousness annulment. However, reading is part of the geographer's craft, where analysis replace reading, therefore ruling out its automatic dimension. Nevertheless, to move about, to outdistance, to take or lose one's bearings are metaphorically used while reading. This spatial knowledge is further achieved with hypertexte, which could be better used than current text to organise and unfold geographic knowledge.

AB  - New area of research, risk and catastrophe, whether they are of natural, technological, economical, or sanitary origin, never cease to worry people. Very complex, risk and disaster are the main focus of this paper. This complexity is generated notably by « domino effects », which emerge particularly during urban catastrophe. In this context, they are considered as essential by the majority of risks specialists. But in spite of this weight often granted to « domino effects » in urban environments, it seems that few models only really integrate them. Because system dynamics modelling allows the comprehension of this complexity, it has been retained to build models of risk and catastrophe. This has been implemented using Stella Research software which simulates stocks and flows equations. This modelling allowed on one side, to integrate the component « domino effect » in the disaster system, to overcome the fracture between nature and society ; on the other side it gave the possibility to surpass the static vision of phenomena and to privilege their study as dynamic systems. This communication proposes a model which simulates a very well known « domino effect » : motorists panic during flooding. First, the model is built. Then, we give a few simulation results concerning the Genoa urban area (Italy) during the swelling of the Bisagno river, on October 8, 1970. This model is one of the rare examples of the emergence of a « domino effect » in the field of urban catastrophe.

AB  - In qualitative research, a methodology is more then a description of the techniques and methods to be used. It's the place of an ethical reflection on the way "one directs one's conduct" as a re-searching person. A qualitative method always incorporates a dimension transforming it into an intellectual and existential posture. Such a definition of method as posture allows one to seize the "boundaries of trust" of qualitative research, of "the techniques and sources" which it mobilizes. Constructing objectivity thus implies clarifying the different forms of a global social experience the researcher meets in his field work.

AB  - In recent years several studies have examined changes in the distribution of poverty in the North American cities, with most empirical work assessing neighbourhood change between two time points. This paper aims to make a methodological contribution to the study of neighbourhood change, by comparing two classification methods, one classical (k-means clustering) the other more novel (Latent Class Growth Modelling; LCGM) to identify groups of census tracts having followed similar trajectories of poverty in the Montreal metropolitan area, Canada. Here trajectories of poverty are measured over a twenty year period, using five time points. The relative performance of the LCGM vs. the k-means clustering was assessed using a series of multinomial logistic regressions examining how different socioeconomic variables were associated with the trajectories of poverty. Results showed that k-means and LCGM identified similar groups of census tracts characterised by ascending, descending, or stable poverty levels throughout the period, with LGCM only marginally outperforming k-means clustering.

AB  - For less than a decade, the combined use of values and narrative communication has been becoming increasingly important in the steering of urban projects. The present article discusses this transformation of urban production, which occurs at the same time as a transformation in the condition of urban planners. To this end, the advent of coordinated planning subsequent to the generalisation of the urban project ideology is reviewed. Then, the assumption of a dematerialisation of urban planning correlative to the emergence of a motion paradigm is discussed. Finally, the emergence of values and narratives in urban projects at the same time as a collapse of rules and regula is considered from the point of view of the reconfiguration that it causes in the field of professional practice. Making free use of the material of recent research on urban planning trades, the article shows that the transformations underway do not occur smoothly, contrary to what is being said by the apologists of the new urban planning.

AB  - The Pyrenean mountain pastures are most often a community resource, exploited by communities of people in high valleys. Large-scaled, territorial divisions of these mountain summer pastures are essentially defined by the practice during the pasture-ground livestock from pastoral huts. To consider these practices and shares at different times, from the pastoral sites documented by archaeology, the archaeological study aims to understand the physical and social determinants of livestock routes, and their material correlates. To work on the dynamics of pastoral land in the long term in Bearn, thought had to be considered on the organization of data used. A conceptual data model was designed according to the HBDS method based on hypergraphs; it involves the explaining of all phenomena that come into play and allows the integration of different spatial and temporal scales. Interactions between men, resources and herds are planned over a long period, at different levels of spatiotemporal organization, from the work of geo-agronomists, the knowledge of landscape ecology and archaeology. Used as an integrator tool, this model has been constructed in a dialectical process between data acquisition and their structuring. The formalization and modelling are an effective way to understand a complex system enlightened by several sources at multiple scales of space and time.

The outcomings highlight a perception of an unequal distribution and regionalization (localization in French regions), which sometimes lacks of consistency and undermines the program. The increase in the number of individual strategies is apparently the unintended result of this policy. The parties who pretty much depend on subsidies adopt various strategies and attitudes in order to keep their activities and income. Farmers have mainly a short term view on the prosperity of their farm. They hardly plan their future ahead and their working habits. One of the reasons put forward by the farmers, is a lack of communication networks.

Metropolization is presented to the public as the future of humanity. Here we demonstrate that it is primarily the result of the long-term Crisis, started in the seventies and in which capitalism survives by indulging in his penchant for rent, predatory economy, and spatial adjustment usually called Globalization. Metropoles are the spatial pressure points of that « new economy ». Metropolization, in which, as all geographic studies show, the imbalances and inequalities increase, is the urban pretense of a reality of spatial inversion, and de-urbanization in centrifugal flow created by the crisis.

AB  - This paper discusses the relations between nation-states through the example of football (soccer). More precisely, we analyse from a geopolitical point of view the introduction in the main European championships of quotas limiting the number of non-national players, as well as the absence or presence of a policy of integration for players of foreign origins in national selections. To illustrate this, we adopt a historical perspective to better understand the ways through which soccer, and sports more generally, have become instrumentalised by nation-states in the context of the two World Wars. Moreover, we analyse recent developments regarding quota policies in relation to the emergence of the European Union, with emphasis on the permeability and displacement of frontiers for the free movement of professional football players. We then move to consider the national issue in football by showing that, if the European nation-states tried to homogenise their territories, in order to improve instrumentally the performance, naturalised players were integrated into national teams from the 1920’s onwards. However, not all nation-states adopted the same policy. This is shown through the example of the differential integration of players from colonised territories, as well as by the comparison between France and Germany. Finally, in the light of the concepts of denationalisation and transnationalism, we analyse the latest developments in the use of naturalised players by countries such as Qatar and Togo.

AB  - <r2r:ml lang="fr"><p class="resume">The relationships between space, power and identity are necessarily mediated by symbols. A symbol is a concrete reality (a building, a statue, a coin, etc.) that communicates something intangible (an idea, a value, a feeling) : consequently, a place of power is by definition a symbolic place, which is a vehicle for power in the spatial order and for space in the order of power. The symbolic mediations between these different orders of reality are therefore produced and interpreted only in the context in which they emerge. A place can be considered as “ symbolic ” whenever it means something to a group of individuals, in such a way that it contributes to giving an identity to the group. With examples taken across the Americas, this paper investigates how symbolic places are produced and controlled by public authorities, civil societies and economic actors.</p></r2r:ml>

AB  - The French colonial city of Saint-Louis du Senegal, declared as World Heritage by UNESCO, is built on a sandbank island in the estuary of the Senegal River (west coast of Africa).On the west side of Saint-Louis, a long and narrow sandspit, the Barbary Tongue (Langue de Barbarie), protects the town from marine submersions. Until the end of 2003, the island of Saint-Louis was located approximately thirty kilometers in upstream from the river mouth. Therefore, the town was subjected to recurring flood events, often occurring towards the end of the rainy season, due to low discharge conditions of river water into the ocean. To reduce the problem, a breach was opened in the Barbary Tongue in early October 2003, about 7 km southward from the city. After a few months, the gap has widened dramatically and there is now a considerable increase in marine influence in the hydrological regime. The aim of our study is to analyse consequences of such event on flood hazards evolution, knowing that Saint-Louis has not experienced further significant flooding, river waters being rapidly drains off during flood events. As the city of Saint-Louis is lying slightly above the level of actual high seas, it might be vulnerable to rising sea level, even moderate. In this context, we try to discuss what could be the consequences of sea level rise on the city, if marine influence should persist in the regime of Senegal river in the years to come. A model was developped to simulate flood propagation in the city for various scenarios, made from estimates of rising sea level by the end of the century (IPCC, 2007; Rahmstorf et al, 2007; Grinsted et al, 2009). It shows that the town of Saint-Louis could be flooded during the highest annual water during the 21st century.

AB  - Since the Regionalization and physical planning law has been promulgated in 1982 and after the vote of the Constitution on March 29, 1987, the traditional macro-economic and sectorial planning system, without spatial dimension, has been put in question in Haïti in favor of a new approach evolving around the necessary integration of the spatial dimension in the elaboration of economic and social development Plans and Programs. Contrary to the old habits based on excessive centralization, the article 81 of the new Constitution of Haïti indicates a real willingness to promote decentralization : «The departmental Council has to elaborate the departmental development Plan with the support of the Public Administration sector». It is in this context that the actual planning problematic must be understood : it involves, without contest, the active participation of territorial and local collectivities at all levels of decisions making. However, territorial planning in Haïti is facing a lot of problems : the Constitution has established, since 1987, some mechanisms to put in place in order to promote decentralization in Haïti, but until now the new planning system based on decentralization is still in gestation. All structures that have been anticipated by Constitution, even when they exist, are not functional. Therefore no departmental Plan has not emerged yet, in spite of the constitutional injunctions that are twelve years old. The actual study offers a diagnosis of the economic and socal situation of Haïti and analyses the methodological frame and the necessary instruments for elaborating departmental Plans in Haïti. It insists on the adequate functionning of a national planning frame (National Scheme of physical planning) to be used as a guide in elaborating departmental Schemes of physical planning and departmental Plans.

It is based on the synthesis of travel behaviour considering individual consumption-oriented trips obtained through an origin-destination survey. The analytical procedure uses GIS for modelling actual trips on a road network, thereby enabling consideration of accessibility peculiarities related to road infrastructures. It is aimed at delineating primary and secondary market areas for each shopping alternative, at studying spatial competition and at providing preliminary diagnosis on the overall impact of newly-implemented big boxes on the sustainability of traditional shopping centres and business streets.

AB  - Landscape elements influence fauna movements. The information is collected so that to identify obstacles and interesting corridors: locations of animals and topographical databases describing the spatial environment. The aim of this research is to simulate fauna movement into spatial areas, both in a real context then in a context modified by infrastructures. We start by analysing the collected movement data and the influence of landscape elements on three species: the red fox, the roe deer and the red deer. The perception of space is different, depending on the species and on the type of environment. As an example, wooded area can be either used for resting or foraging. Then the results of data analyses and knowledge on the species are integrated in a simulation model based on agents. Trajectories are built by taking into account the spatial behaviour of species and the characterization of both obstacles and movement corridors. We finally test the simulation process on a modified area with a road and wildlife infrastructures. We assess the consequences on movements. The model tends to confirm the barrier effect of the motorway even if the effect is reduced by ecological corridors. While the road limits animals’ movements, the corridor favours spatial accessibility and leads to crossings at precise locations. These results highlight the interest of a model in order to assess the efficacy of wildlife preservation such as the measure of “Trame verte et bleue”.

AB  - The city of Khartoum experienced a rapid growth and an urban spread towards its periphery that has become denser than the centre. Urban planning was unable to follow the pace of demographic growth, and the establishment of a decent drinking water network is slow. The population is incited to be independent from quantitative variations by storing drinking water, because of water turbidity, many cuts, and pressure decreases. These bad habits of storage, the lack of efficiency of treatment and the absence of a collective supply network maintenance are responsible for a significant decrease in the physical and biological water quality. The result is a development of water-borne diseases (generally diarrheal symptoms and kidney diseases). This study demonstrates that the distinction made between quantity and quality in the institutional management of drinking water in Khartoum is a dead-end. It also suggests that treatment would be more efficient and water would have better quality if smaller quantity of drinking water were produced and the amount of wasted water were reduced.

AB  - The spatial structure of mobility flows is a key element in order to understand the functional reorganisation of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region (France). Mobility flows can be used to define urban networks and to follow their evolution over time. This paper analyses inter-municipal dominant flows of daily and residential mobility derived from census data over the 1980s and the 1990s. On the whole, regional urban networks grow stronger and become more complex over time. They shape two metropolitan networks showing different network configurations. Other differences can be observed between the spatial extent of commuting dominant flows, which are linked to the daily functioning of metropolitan areas, and that of residential mobility dominant flows, which are more linked to household life cycles.

AB  - Over the last ten years, geographical scale has been at the forefront of academic enquiry in political geography. Scale has been used to demonstrate the social construction of space, and to illustrate how space is framed in particular ways to satisfy political ends. What the scale literature lacks, however, is an acknowledgement of how socio-cultural actors play an important role in these constructions and how cultural (as well as political and economic) processes are thoroughly implicated in the construction of space. This paper demonstrates, through an empirical study of national identity in the Saturday Evening Post during World War Two, how the national space is articulated through different geographical scales. It shows how scales frame particular images of the nation so that readers are provided with an understanding of the meaning of the United States of America, and their place in it. The paper concludes that this application of scale to cultural geographical enquiries is useful for demonstrating the political significance of geographical scale for ordering civil society.

First, we show that the number and the rate of building of this equipment follow logistic equations over a 50 years period of time. Rank-size curves show some hierarchies of lift characteristics. Using the Fractalyse code, we confirm that the spatial distribution of the two networks – approximated to an invariant scale system- is relevant to fractal geometry. The values of the fractal dimensions depend on the opportunities of the lifts, of the difficulties of the slopes, and of the distribution of the two networks. Some conclusions could be deduced from these results to characterize the ski resorts.

AB  - Many poor households cannot meet the requirements of automotive mobility. They suffer great inequalities in their daily mobility, especially when they live away from urban centers, in areas where the provision of public transport and local amenities are reduced. Nevertheless, a normative interpretation in terms of shortages, based on the observation of low mobility capacity, underestimates the concrete mobility practices of poor households, and secondly how these households bypass the injunction of mobility required of them. This set of alternative practices – be they tactics, strategies, and projects – can substitute expensive automotive mobility with a set of resources drawn fundamentally from spatial proximity. This article aims to analyze the diversity of these practices, their quantitative importance and nesting, for the case of Paris suburban and periurban areas. To conclude, it draws how the variety of adjustments exhibited by poor households could be taken into account by public action.

We know also that riemannian spaces are the formal apparatus of General Relativity. In Einstein's theory (1915), gravitation is nothing but space-time curvature. All along this paper, we shall try to extend gravity models by substituting for the Newton's law a relativistic model based on a riemannian space. We also try to answer the different kinds of problems raised by our theory : for instance, discontinuity of space, non symmetric matrices of distances, non-constant curvature, locally non euclidean riemannian spaces, etc.

AB  - As the land use -and the density - is a predominant factor to determine the level of risks, the european and national laws plan to limit the land uses around dangerous industrial plants, like fuel oil storages. In urban areas, it leads to reduce the construction possibilities ; that is why planners sometimes proposed to remove those embarrassing industries. But then, they don’t take into account that the flows of dangerous substances may grow and increase transport-risks. With the help of a GIS where land use is precisely discribed, a method is developped to compare risks around a dangerous plant and risks relevant to the dangerous flows to and from that plant. It is based on the calculation of damages within the areas potentially touched by the consequences of an accident. The GIS is very useful to count these damages at a regional scale (where dangerous substances are delivered) and to compare the risks for various simulated locations of a plant in order to check the pertinence of the planners propositions of removal. The case of fuel oil storage and road trafic has been chosen, as they take place in a large urban area, the region of Ile - de-France for our example.

AB  - After the last two centuries of intense and unprecedented urbanization, we need a clear understanding of the ongoing trends of urban growth for a better insight of their possible future. Two main processes are analysed : first, the inter-urban concentration of population, with its consequence of a relative decline of the smallest towns ; second, urban sprawl, including a shift of population density in the central part of cities towards their peripheries. Using recent data on population and employment in French urban functional areas, we show that the spatial and temporal framework in which urban growth is computed may considerably alter the results and their consecutive interpretation. When the city is defined as a continuously built-up area (the French agglomération), the measurement of concentration of urban population does not give the same result than when using as a definition the spatial scale of functional urban areas (the French aires urbaines). Similarly, the analyse of the spatial redistribution of population between urban centres, close and outer suburbs are reconsidered under trends of a longer duration has been given very different results, according to the way of defining cities and spaces.

AB  - The rate of urban development in flood-prone areas in the Paris region continues unabated. The new State orthodoxy in matters of urban planning predominantly rests on reducing the vulnerability of goods and population to flood risks which, as stated by French public authorities, should not systematically be equated to withholding development approvals or freezing risk-exposed territories. The challenge consists in controlling urbanization of the most exposed areas while providing the means for urban and economic development of already urbanized and less exposed areas. The new position taken by the State is leading contracting authorities to reoccupy sparcely urbanized flood-prone districts with the aim of constructing more housing and office buildings. In so doing, the planning strategies and principles at the nexus of environmental approaches to the compact city converge. This article reflects on the design of an urban renewal project “Seine Ardoines” (an industrial district in the town of Vitry-sur-Seine in the Ile-de-France region) and shows how the design process can benefit from the “guide plan”. Implemented as an original planning tool, it enables flood risks to be integrated into the urban regeneration of an industrial site, without calling into question the development strategies promoted by the local authorities.

AB  - The reservation for sustainable development of the Iratapuru river is exploited by the community of the São Francisco village. Due to its efforts to organize itself and to improve the life conditions of its member, but also due to a massive state and federal support, this village has become a symbol of the efforts made towards “traditional communities” of the Amazon. Its exemplarity has become greater after 2004, when an innovative form of partnership has been established with a great cosmetic firm, Natura Inc.. But the new relationship between those partners raises a number of question, about its consequences from a geographical point of view or about the legitimacy of each of the institution managing the reservation. This article offers a synthesis of those questions. First we present the geographical context and the principal activity of São Francisco, the gathering and selling of the Brazil nut. We then show how the partnership with Natura comes after a long list of attempts to develop the local economy. Lastly, we underpin some questions that remain despite the image of a reasoned exploitation of natural resources, such as the limits of the role of Natura towards the COMARU cooperative, its economic partner, and towards the community, whose image is a part of Natura’s marketing.

AB  - Confronted to the shrinkage of their traditional worker electorate, European social democrat parties have aimed to enlarge their electoral base to the intermediary salaried classes. This strategy submits these parties to a permanent dilemma since the intermediate and the working classes hold very different ideological and political views. These gaps between social classes inside the parties are reinforced by huge gaps between territories. We will show for the Belgian case that the electoral base of social democrat parties is very heterogeneous in ideological terms, because of its social and territorial diversity. We will finally state the hypothesis that the social supervision related to the parties enables them to cope with this dilemma with different results.

AB  - Aspects relating to the environment, and more particularly climate change, are increasingly holding the stage when it comes to the way the media processes information. Of course, the link between climate change and winters without snow, so-called exceptional flooding, devastating hurricanes or summer heatwaves is perfect material for the headlines of dailies and weeklies. But, what’s more, the concept of global warming is systematically in the headlines because it has become a major stake for society, the environment and the economy. Thus, the written press is calling upon its readers to be conscious of this problem but also to play an active role in this domain. Subsequently, the press tends to call upon us – to its credit – in relation to “good practices” to stop us from wasting energy, and proposes alternatives, which, in general, are not very restrictive. Often, the choice of a “clean” car appears to be an alternative. But compared with the car industry, is the written press coherent with what it puts on paper and the actions it promotes through the adverts it authorises for publication? Therefore, the objective of this paper is to provide an answer to the following three questions: 1] What is the position of car advertising in the written press? 2] What level of emissions are promoted in this advertising in relation to the objectives to be achieved? 3] What could be the solutions to this problem? A detailed analysis of car advertising was carried out in 2006 in four bodies of the Belgian French-speaking written press. The results of this study show that advertising boasts of cars which, in terms of CO2 emissions per kilometre, are from another age, and clearly contradict the values recommended in the in-depth articles written by the journalists of this type of media.

AB  - Since 1996, French urban and social policies have focused on areas with enduring economic problems. Neighbourhood statistics allows to map the “areas of deprivation”, as defined by public policies as ZUS (Zones urbaines sensibles) They have been initially characterized by high rates of social housing, districts of degraded housing environment and a big mismatch between housing and employment. ZUS are mostly located in the suburbs of larger cities, and in spite of urban regeneration policies, the reputation of such places did not improve over time, and yields negative externalities on residential household choices. In order to get a better understanding upon housing markets, this paper aims to evaluate relations between prices of real estate and distance from a ZUS. To what extent property prices increase when located out the ZUS? To this end, we use the BIEN database (base d’informations économiques notariales) bought from the Parisian notary public board. This allows us to analyse dynamics of the residential housing market by the means of hedonic price indices in ZUS areas. Real estate data not only provides the characteristics of housing but also their location, in or out the ZUS. As a general trend, data show that house prices are negatively influenced by proximity of a ZUS, in part depending on their locations. Among the findings, the close neighbor of a ZUS generates a negative financial externality. The ambitious program of urban renewal implemented after 2004 will certainly modify this trend but we were not able to measure it within the scope of this study.

AB  - When it was adopted in 1999, the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP) was considered as a guiding document for actions and policies dealing with spatial planning from European to local levels. As a non-binding document, it was supposed to “shape minds” of actors implementing spatial planning actions and policies. However, according to a report published in 2007 by a consortium of European researchers within the framework of the European Spatial Planning Observatory Network, the ESDP remained widely ignored. According to the report, this situation could be explained by a weak dissemination of the ESDP objectives at European and infra-European levels. This article argues that the weak impact of the ESDP is less related to the unsatisfactory process of information dissemination than to the technocratic making of the ESDP. It argues that what is at stake when dealing with ESDP type document is the involvement of the actors in charge to implement policies, notably at infra-national scales. Taking into consideration this situation, the author makes propositions to insure a better application of European objectives in terms of spatial planning.

AB  - The paper suggests an alternative index for socio-spatial segregation which emphasises agents’ segregation in everyday life. We argue that segregation should be studied for individual agents in respect to the spaces in which they perform their everyday life. The index refers both to the spatial and the social-interactive contexts of seven aspects (home, cluster of neighbouring homes, neighbourhood and city in the spatial context and friends, work and leisure activities in the social context) of agents’ everyday life actions as they are actually performed in their everyday time-spaces. The paper calculates the segregation of seven persons who represent seven typical lifestyles. Each lifestyle differs in its preferences for location in social spaces and in performing everyday life activity orbits. The index may receive negative values representing agents’ tendency toward exposure to members of alternative groups and positive values representing tendency toward segregation. In practice, the distribution of the segregation index changed between +- 4.0. In addition, no correlation between spatial and social segregation has been identified. Several agents were socially much more segregated than spatially, while others were spatially more segregated than socially.

AB  - The territorial vulnerability analysis aims to identify, characterize and prioritize areas from which vulnerability is generated and disseminated in a territory. Risk prevention should give priority to these areas because they can disrupt, jeopardize or interrupt the functioning and development of the territory.The approach was developed under the research program entitled "Information System and Risks in the Metropolitan District of Quito”. The article aims to explain this approach, based on the identification of strategic areas of the territory and the analysis of their vulnerability, and the methodology leading to the cartography of Quito’s territorial vulnerability.

AB  - A deep and profond lifelessness depicts the malagasy capital city at night. How to explain this sleep of the sole economical, political and cultural center of the island ? There is a real paradox that we need to analyze before all. Nevertheless, this quietness should not hide the presence in the streets of families and children who live there night and day. Therefore to take a look at the night life of Antananarivo brings a question about urban identities and temporalities. On the one hand, there are those that claim the legitimacy of their city-dwelling status – the inhabitants- , on the other hand, those who are excluded from it.

AB  - The quantitative study of an infrastructure network in geography often consists in assessing indicators on the network components (nodes and sections). In that respect, the network is modelled by a graph whose vertices and edges respectively correspond to the nodal and linear network infrastructures. Then, such a graph can be studied thanks to tools provided by the graph theory and mainly based on the shortest paths features. The most typical indicators are accessibility (closeness from a given vertex to the others graph vertices, computed in summarizing the shortest path lengths) and centrality or “betweenness” (contribution of a given vertex or edge to the origin-destination paths, computed in counting the shortest paths passing through this component). For this reason, accessibility and centrality features of a vertex depend on the shortest paths distribution on the network, and also on the relative location of the vertex inside the network. However, the spatial location of vertices predisposes them to be accessible and central, regardless of the relational potentialities provided by the network structure. Actually, a vertex located at the centre (resp. on the periphery) of the network area is more (resp. less) likely to be accessible and central. Therefore, it seems relevant to highlight how the network makes the vertices accessible and central, independently on the advantages only provided by their spatial location. Then, we show that it is possible to make allowances for the corresponding “network and spatial effects” by comparing the shortest paths traditionnally taken into account to compute these indicators with a set of optimal paths called “Delaunay paths”. Besides the study of accessibility and centrality indicators, our method can be extended to the study of any indicator (structural or not), as long as such an indicator is usually computed from shortest paths. It finally provides a useful tool to interpret indicators on a network and to understand the networks contribution to the phenomena described by these indicators.

AB  - French urban law has been conceived as a framework for the urbanization of unused space. However, at present, its usefulness for the development of already urbanized areas is questioned. This is particularly true for the two main instruments of local planning, the Plan d’Occupation du Sol (POS) and the Zones d’Aménagement Concertés (ZAC). But the consequences of local urban planning on the real estate activity in the short and the long run are not well known. This study aims at analyzing how local urban policies - and in particular the rules of the POS and the ZAC - determine the change in urban texture. The research carried out is original in that it focusses on the urban transformation at the level of land lots by the means of a data base on building permissions. This instrument allows us to analyze the spatial dimension of the change in real estate activity quantitatively. It is used to study the urban transformation of two municipalities in the western Parisian outskirts - Issy-Les-Moulineaux and Boulogne-Billancourt - since 1980. The study shows that the rights to build and the programs of ZACs may influence the real estate activity and its spatial distribution significantly. However this link is not systematic and exhibits non trivial features.

AB  - The term éco-quartier is today largely used by urban planners or stakeholders. It is often considered as synonym for quartier durable. Both terms would designate the urban projects with ambitious environmental, societal, and economic objectives, multiplied in France since the last few years. However, in practice, people do not all agree with this point of view. Are these sustainable urban projects quartiers durables or éco-quartier or both? This article aims at highlighting this question of vocabulary, even if an academic definition of this urban object has not been found. The pertinence of using the expression éco-quartier or quartier durable to designate new urban districts created in recent human and environmental sustainable context will be analysed. From that moment on, we will consider the different uses of these expressions taking into account the material, theoretical and temporal context where these new urban elements are inserted. Finally, we will show that utilisation of one term or the other goes beyond vocabulary and reveal a part of French urban planning trend.

AB  - Now is the time for global information systems that would abolish space and would entail the end of the territories, or so are we asked to believe. Several sites on the internet blossomed and advertise the idea of the creation of brand new on-line States, with their own laws, constitution and citizenship. These sites could express the desire for a new kind of political community. However, one has to realize that the most serious of these sites convey very classical territorial images rather than developing this new concept of virtual State.

It is possible to identify time spaces, some of them only sketches, other very strongly defined: oil time spaces linked to globalization, time spaces of the “travelling” upper classes, times spaces of the oil-workers, time spaces of the more popular social classes living in the suburbs, the very fluctuating time spaces of guerrilla warfare, festive time spaces now become more commercial, time spaces of speculators thwarting urban planning, etc.

AB  - We try here to illustrate the relevance of an evolutionary theory of urban systems for explaining their hierarchical properties. The largest cities became larger because they were successful in adopting many successive innovations. Larger cities capture innovations in a continuous way (through adaptation, imitation, anticipation), and they concentrate a larger part of anything « new » at any time. Their functions demonstrate a higher level of complexity or sophistication of their urban activity and society. The most advanced technologies concentrate in largest cities, the common place activities are ubiquitous, whereas old ones remain in small towns only (or, in economic terms, there are increasing, constant or decreasing returns to urban scale). Such regularities can be expressed in the form of scaling laws that were recognised as revealing specific constraints on the structure and evolution of complex systems in physics and biology. Approaching urban activities by scaling laws provides a linkage between the concepts of urban function, city size, and innovation cycles. Over time, there is a substitution among the activities of the largest cities, where the oldest technologies and professions are replaced by the new ones, while the old ones are relatively concentrating in the smallest towns. Such an evolution is observed within urban systems where cities are fully connected and interdependent. There are processes of cooperation through exchanges of information and learning that enable an incremental diffusion of innovation and a continuous adaptation of urban activities and society in all parts of the system. Meanwhile, there are also processes of competition between cities that enhance their capacity to innovate and to levy the benefits of innovation. A distributed process of urban growth including a slight but continuing advantage for the largest cities is the result of that competitive process, while the successive adaptation of the urban functions follows the economic and social innovation cycles.

In this article, we present and compare two simulation’s models for describing an agricultural conquest’s process. In one model the agents are defined at the level of individuals, as actors of change.

This article asks whether a tsunami warning system is needed in the Indian Ocean, where the probability of experiencing a similar catastrophe is very small. In addition, other alternatives, including land use planning and education focused on tsunami risk management, are presented. Their application could considerably reduce financial and human losses if a disaster of this nature was to occur again.

AB  - The numerous studies on global cities published over the last thirty years have failed to consider a large category of cities impacted both by globalization and by the widescale competition between urban projects it engenders. Baltic cities, which are often small urban areas, do not always have sufficient funds and leverage to become directly integrated into global and European processes. However, if they want to attract tourists, investments, and inhabitants, they have to highlight their comparative advantages by implementing active international policies. The Baltic scale may thus provide a stepping stone leading to larger scales. The intense cooperation among municipalities in the Baltic Sea Region since the 1990s and the fall of the Iron Curtain is part of this issue. This has led to the emergence of inequalities between large metropolitan areas which have obtained a very high level of internationalization, and medium-sized cities whose influence is currently limited to the Baltic region alone.

AB  - The presentation of fractal analysis of the metropolitan area of Milan begins with an historical description of the evolution of the urbanization process of the city, in order to characterize precise and homogenous areas (from a historical point of view). These areas will be analyzed using the fractal technique. Three main aspects characterize the fractal analysis of Milan : the study of the perimeter of the city, using the method of the dilatation in order to extract the perimeter, and correlation analysis in order to calculate the fractal dimension ; the study of whole urbanized surfaces, using correlation, dilatation and grid analysis ; the study of some areas of the city that have been described in the first part of the presentation. The results are then introduced and discussed, focusing on the relationship between the value of the fractal dimension and the city context to which it refers, and comparing among fractal dimensions of selected areas.

AB  - The advent of the « new economy », embodied by the expansion of the internet, would be the signal of the end of geography and space. Distances are reportedly abolished as markets are from now on at a klick away. E-trade and the advent of Enterprise Ressource Planning (ERP) systems would provide firms with the tools they can use to free themselves of space. In fact, the internet and ERP for sure change the relationship between firms and their space and their markets, but they do not disrupt them: location choices are still geographic. The need to transport faster and efficiently, brought about by the expansion of E-trade, establishes transportation as the effort of mastering space. It translates into the fast expansion of cargo airliners in logistics.

AB  - Since the late 1960s, the Sahel is affected by a dramatic drought. This article analyses climatic variations recorded in the Gouré area, eastern Niger, between 1936 and 2003. It appears that the drought ended in the late 1980s. However, the rainfall increase did not lead to an extension of the length of the rainy season. The study of the wind shows that correct data were recorded during the two first years of the station of Gouré (1984 and 1985). Afterwards, wind speed was entached by errors and did not report since 1997. The situation is alarming as we know that neighbouring stations meet the same problems and that no synoptic station currently reports wind values in eastern Niger. However, based on wind speed and deflation data recorded in 1984, a threshold wind speed of 7 m/s was determined in Gouré. Finally, from measurements of horizontal visibility reduced by mineral dust, our results suggest that air quality is reduced because of the high frequency of wind erosion. The confrontation of our results with recent environmental studies in that region show that the end of the drought did not lead to any landscape improvement. Increasing human pressure tends to be the main driving factor of land degradation.

AB  - Recent developments in interactive and dynamic cartography and development of Internet technologies are largely contributed to increase the number of interactive atlases on Internet. With client/server technologies and vector formats for Internet, it’s now possible to deploy rapidly interactive web-atlases. In this methodological article, we expose a simple and effective approach based on C#, ASP.Net and SVG to product interactive atlases on Internet. This approach is very useful for two reasons: the cartographic production is very simple and fast, and the development of interactive and dynamic mapping functions is facilitated and almost unlimited.

AB  - This paper analyses the construction of the image of oriental women in the production of commercial photography between the 1860’s and the 1880’s. It is based on an unpublished corpus: a collection of 1568 photographs purchased by the Genevan traveler Alfred Bertrand (1856-1924) between 1874 and 1883. By studying this corpus, this paper shows the differential photographic treatment existing between oriental women and oriental men. It first details the techniques used by the photographers yielding this differentiation, such as the process of decontextualization and recontextualization and the association between eroticization and typification. It then suggests some possible explanations for these differences, such as the constraints imposed on the photographers (norms of the societies of origin of the photographers, rules of the societies photographed, material conditions), and the imaginaries and ideologies of these photographers (fascination with oriental women, the supposed inferiority of oriental societies). Finally, it highlights the role of the customers of these photographers.

AB  - The growing social interest on environmental issues has fostered the attention paid by various disciplines to problems of locating noxious facilities. During some years, the location theory, mainly developed to answer questions such as the best place for economic or social facilities, has also been considering this subject and has formulated several models to solve well structured problems. Grounded on this trend, this paper, first of all, summarizes some limitations of existing models, and next proposes a unified optimization model that enlarges the scope of the former ones. Additionally, and incorporating different transformations of the basic model, it is shown how it can be adapted to solve a wider set of problems. Finally, and as example, a simple application is carried out using a raster geographical information system

AB  - The spatial influence of cities is analysed through the innovation diffusion of modern andrare activities, and the network of corresponding firms and their etablishments. The analysis of the diffusion provides information on recent spatial dynamics in Tunisia, the models of this diffusion, the changes brought to the urban hierarchy and theinevitable downgrading of some centers.   This text analyzes the innovation diffusion of, modern and rare activities, multi-plant company network in Tunisia between 1997 and 2004. It shows that the spatial diffusion operates mainly at the national level according to a hierarchical process while the proximity works at the regional level. On another level, the city of Sousse reinforces its place contrarily to the second town Sfax whereas the littoral is still privileged by this process, announcing the future Tunisian space.

The Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) in particular have introduced new methods for the cartographic community to display and distribute map information. In conjunction with a wider audience, the Internet and WWW are presenting new commercial opportunities. The technical limitations for the current implementation of the Internet are slowing the process, yet are being rapidly rectified by the IT industry. This paper aims to highlight some of these problems, along with a brief appraisal of the mapping industry on the WWW.

AB  - The complex system paradigm and agent-based modeling are more and more used as new approaches in social sciences. These methods and tools bring new perspectives on known facts but also allow us to test new hypotheses on social dynamics. Their use is extremely interesting in the study of how environment and society interact, and especially in the study of the emergence of urbanisation. Six models forming a ’modelography’ are considered in this paper: Sugarscape, by J.M. Epstein and R. Axtell; Anasazi, from The Artificial Anasazi Project; The Village Project, from the Village Ecodynamics project; ENKIMDU, from the MASS project; SimPop, from the Géographie-cités Laboratory; and a model of urban center emergence, by A. Ourednik and P. Dessemontet. A new method to describe and compare these models is used. It will help identify the contributions or the possible improvements of the exiting modeling techniques developed to better understand this complex problem.

AB  - This paper aims at analysing the process of regionalisation, i.e. the formation of large geographical ensembles or macroregions. Inside these macroregions, the international trade tends to increase faster than at the global level. What are the most relevant indicators to determinate their geographical limits? In order to answer this question, the paper proposes the analysis of the commercial relations between European Union and Russia until 2004. Is Russia involved in the regionalisation process? Does it progressively enter the economic region dominated by the European Union? The first part of the paper shows that the supposed process of regionalisation must be qualified, as far as the relation between Russia and EU are concerned. Russia is getting more and more important in the external trade of EU, but the contrary is not true. The second part is based on the analysis of another indicator: the coefficient of bilateral trade. It was invented and perfected by economists of the CEPII (Gaulier, 1998). It allows to measure trade proximity between partners by comparing observed trade flows between them to their theoretical volume. In other terms, it shows the real intensity of trade between countries by eliminating the bias related to size effects (economic weight). The evolution of this coefficient between Russia and all its European partners (Western Europe, CEE countries, CIS members) is systematically analysed since 1994 until 2004. The last part of the paper is focused on the explanations of the geographical distribution of the coefficient and of its evolution since 1994. It is then based on a model which proposes three explanatory variables: kilometric distance between partners, the location in the European political and economic space (does the partner belong to Western Europe, to Central and Eastern Europe or to the former USSR) and the number of political frontiers between partners. The second variable shows the highest degree of correlation with the coefficient of bilateral trade. That means that the economic space inherited from the cold war period has not totally disappeared yet. The limits between former USSR, former popular democracies and former Western Europe do not inhibit trade relations between Russia and its non CIS partners, but they still keep them under their theoretical level.

AB  - This paper examines the long-term changes of travel patterns in urbanized and semi-urbanized areas of Sweden. Travel survey data reveal a connection between built-up area size/density and distance travelled. This relation is not linear. People living within the medium-sized towns travel the least daily distance. This is not congruent with the idea that increases in population densities within towns - the strategies of compact cities - would reduce the amount of travel. Since 1978 people living in medium-sized towns have reduced their use of the car and increased the use of the bicycle. The results indicate the potential for behavioural changes within the existing spatial structures.

AB  - During the last decades, vast suburbs were formed around Algerian cities. Planned or not, these suburbs are of different varieties. This work will draw the opposition between  two kinds of these suburbs by analysing the inhabitants perceptions about the living spaces that this suburbs offer. Called Bengladesch, the "600 habitations", section is included in  the large planned site of the western valley situated in the suburbs of Annaba. In the 1980’s, this programme offered housing for a part of the population which was previously living in an informal site. Considered today as the true Medina of Guelma, Oued Skhoun is, on the contrary a sprawling and informal urban space which includes a real commercial dynamic. Bengladesh or Medina, the inhabitants perceptions related to these two spaces are, there fore, radically contradictory. Rationally planned, the "600 habitations" section is, nevertheless, a poor and ill-conditioned region. On the other hand, Oued Skhoun propose sprawling urban forms  liable to bring profit for the whole inhabitants of Guelma.

AB  - Analysing how discourse on “neoliberalism” has spread spatially since the 1930s brings to light a series of geographical transpositions linked to recurrent semantic splits. The reference to “neoliberalism”, which first appeared in France and designated a European school of thought, has since been applied to various geographic areas (West Germany, the Latin American states, the world) to qualify contrasting political practices. These successive geo-semantic shifts have resulted in a polysemic, confusing and contradictory label. In these conditions, it seems necessary to try and better define the various forms of neoliberalism that structure the political organisation of different places and the societies that inhabit them.

AB  - The concept of 'Mediterranean' has been widely studied and discussed over the past two decades. This article will attempt to answer the following question: to what extent can we use the term 'Mediterranean' to describe areas other than the Mediterranean? In order to control the sometimes chaotic analogic use of this term, some writers have proposed certain criteria, for instance, size: 'Mediterranean' is a medium-sized area--a 'mesocosm', as O. Dolfuss described it--of not more than a few thousand kilometers. However, the discussion about the use of 'Mediterranean' for areas of widely differing sizes, such as the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, is deliberately vague. The purpose of this paper is to throw light on this specific issue, and to seek to understand why, between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries, many authors--geographers in particular--used this analogy; were they not seeking to express a new experience of the world, which is globalization?

Urban morphology is measured by built-up and network indicators while mobility and socio-economic characteristics are obtained from the Household Travel Survey (EMD – Enquête ménages déplacements) of Certu (French Centre for the Study of Urban Planning, Transportation and Public Facilities). The built environment indicators based on landscape metrics constitutes our original approach. These indicators are then used in statistical tests to specify relationships between urban morphology and mobility according to urban context. Some morphological indicators of proximity and fragmentation of form of buildings complete socio-economic characteristics to explain urban mobility.

AB  - This article presents a synthetic map of the spatial dynamics of gentrification in Paris since the 1960s. While the notion of gentrification has given rise to numerous studies since the 1970s, in particular in Britain and North America, very few researchers have focused on the spatial dynamics of this process in a given city, or made attempts to map the phenomenon. The synthesis map proposed here is derived from a global, multiscalar approach to gentrification in Paris, and uses three different sources: statistical analyses of the census data for 1982, 1990 and 1999, the work by Daniel Noin and Yvan Chauviré presented in their Atlas des Parisiens (1984), and between 2004 and 2007 surveys in the field in three Paris neighbourhoods at different stages in the gentrification process. These different sources enable an interpretation of gentrification as a process of spatial diffusion from centre to periphery starting from a historical core in the beaux quartiers of the west of Paris. This confirms the analyses reported by the Anglo-American studies, in which gentrification appears as a process of social conquest taking the form of a pioneer frontier. The aim of this article is to present an original cartography of this process using the example of Paris.

AB  - Ecological network concept is a growing core element of conservation strategies. Based on the need to integrate ecological processes which underlie spatial dynamics of biodiversity at a landscape scale, network planning is largely based on a single model that allows the identification of natural core areas and linkage corridors. In this context a structural mapping approach is the most often used means to discuss and identify conservation issues at stake and to prepare recommendations for action. In this paper we analyze the process of ecological network construction at the scale of a Regional Natural Park in southern France. We show that by sticking to a classical and highly technical approach focused on mapping spatial organization, the group of actors involved was unable to produce neither a collective representation of the conservation stakes nor recommend a plan of actions. Our study highlights the need to integrate more correctly the ordinary biodiversity of the landscape matrix and consider that a mapping approach should above all make possible the construction and functioning of a social interaction process.

AB  - After an overview of the issues and the regulatory environment related to the sharing and dissemination of geographical information, this article describes the experimentation conducted for the implementation of an interagency spatial data infrastructure in two regions of France (Haute et Basse-Normandie): namely the Pole Géomatique Interservices Mer et Littoral. It aims to draw some generic lessons applicable to the development of spatial data infrastructures for Integrated Coastal Zone Management. The work carried out has analyzed the organizational and functional conditions of the use of geographic information among government departments and their partners as part of their missions on the coastal zone. Based on the development of technical and methodological recommendations on the sharing of geographic information and on an ongoing animation, the methodology has highlighted the importance of exchange between partners to complement and enhance their geomatics industry and beyond their operational efficiency. In particular, our experience shows that maintenance, sustainability and success of the operational use of a spatial data infrastructure can only be considered with political support. It also shows the role played by the leadership and management of the network partners, essential condition for achieving lean marine and coastal policy guidance on public data sets consistent, comprehensive and updated as possible, in accordance with the requirements set by the European Directive INSPIRE.

The paper pays attention to the role of the multimedia companies in the development of the cultural identity at the territories, and the deal of the cultural goods in the international organizations. At this point a thematic and spatial approach has been achieved, so that we can actually describe the main territorial distribution of the Spanish cultural industry, the multimedia groups, their internal structure and their spatial patterns in Spain.

AB  - Taking the problematic status of “urban heritage land” in Mali as its starting point, this text considers the possibility of a new patrimonial gaze. This approach centers new principles of heritage in a material perspective rooted in a specific place and culture. The Malian case asks us to consider numerous remarkable urban heritage sites that would not survive except as permanent construction sites. That is, the longevity of fragile architectural structures would not be possible without constant repairs. The role of the construction site invites us to consider urban heritage as a phenomenon that is dependent on intangible cultural production. A consideration of the immaterial side of urban heritage allows us to observe the changes that are inherent in the perpetual reestablishment of cultures. This understanding of heritage allows us to track an ontological reversal anchored in the specificity of a localized culture. What are the ontological foundations of Malian urban heritage in earth? Moreover, does this “new heritage” open the doors to the Other of contemporary architecture? And do these new considerations of urban heritage engender a new gaze on contemporary African cities, and in particular, the process of informal urbanization?

AB  - In France the “natural sites” policy have constitued a framework feature for landscape protection that was very used in rural areas. This article surveys how this policy, little known by the broad public and currently considered as not very effective, was used in the Pyrenees mountain. In fact this policy was a real milestone in the history of nature conservancy in these mountains. The article underlines that the “natural site” tool was rather relevant against the claims of industrious programs (dams and hydroelectric plants implementation) but it was less effective to monitoring the expansion of tourism and mountain urbanization. Moreover its implementation needed early a local acceptance : local decision makers and stakeholders looked for monitoring its enforcement. Nowadays this policy seems obsolete because of its weak management capacity and because sometimes it was canted by certain influential players. Its effectiveness depends of each local context. The working of the feature also reflects important differences due to its provincial bulk-heading. However the initiatives established around this feature enabled it to regulate the environmental and socioeconomic conflicts related to land use in mountain area. In fact mountain stakeholders and environmental players used “natural site” framework as a place of discussion and negotiation for mountain regional planning action. This experience benefits to further nature conservancy projects.

AB  - From the eighteenth to the twentieth century, Russian geography developed under the influence of different scientific trends and social practices. The history of the concept of landscape reveals in a spectacular manner the evolution of the geographical approach to the environment. By the beginning of the twentieth century, ‘landscape’ was viewed as a universal category, and was being widely used by the Russian geographers. This term, however, did not appear in Russian geography until the end of the eighteenth century, with the adoption of two words of foreign origin : Landschaft and paysage. For two centuries these words were synonyms, but by 1930-1940, the term Landschaft had been restricted to a scientific meaning, at a time when the word paysage was beginning to be used to refer to scenery. How did the Russian geographical schools affect the evolution of the word landscape ? What led to the divorce between the terms Landschaft and paysage ? What is the role of these two words in contemporary Russian geography ? The author attempts to explain the particularities of the development of Russian geography between the end of the nineteenth and the end of the twentieth century through the analysis of the evolution of the concept of landscape.

AB  - It has already widely been shown that the extension of the urban space takes a polycentric shape : suburban employment sub-centres emerge. The objective in this study is to measure employment concentrations inside and around urban agglomerations and to determine operational tools (methods and data) that lead to the highlighting of these sub-centers. Advantages and limits of the methods are discussed. Our cases studies are Antwerp and Brussels. The results obtained by several methodologies are compared (shift and share analysis, cluster analysis, kernel interpolation and local autocorrelation) for three different types of employment data (social security, population census and regional development statistics) and at three different scales of analysis (individual postal addres, neighbourhood and commune). The main difficulties encountered are : (1) the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the data, and (2) the non-uniqueness of the methodology for discriminating sub-centers. Our conclusion is that there is an emerging polycentric structure in Brussels and Antwerp, but sub-centers are still difficult to put forward. The combination of several different methods and databases is necessary to get insight in the polycentric structure.

AB  - The Canada-US border crosses several villages in its Quebec segment. A few buildings are even built astride the border. The local residents are now used to the peculiarities of the situation, even encouraging it while fostering a solid social and institutional cooperation. This odd situation creates many administrative problems for the residents, all the more so since September 11, 2001. The theoretical debate about artificial boundaries resurfaced among this sudden strengthening of border controls and the reaction among the locals. It would be more accurate to stress border management practices as the core factor for this complex situation.

AB  - While educational geography gets its legitimacy, partly by a declared link with scientific geography, teachers epistemological choices are subjected to a complex set of determinations, not always explicit or conscious. It varies according to individuals and their experiences, situations and job contexts. The notion of a practical connection to epistemology tries to describe the real nature of the work of geography teachers and to makes it sense. Our proposal is based on a didactic approach of to educational geography. It takes into account the way people are related to their jobs and professional world insofar as it constrains what they teach. It develops a methodology called reasoning by case. It is not intended to impose or offer solutions, but to describe and to make sense of facts that are not well known.

On cherche à éclairer deux principaux volets de la relation infrastructures publiques-croissance régionale :<br />les infrastructures publiques ont-elles un effet positif sur la croissance régionale, comme tendraient à le montrer certains modèles de croissance endogène, en particulier, lorsque l’on tient compte de l’effet d’éviction de l’imposition ?<br />ces infrastructures publiques sont-elles des éléments de réduction des disparités régionales, des outils d’aménagement du territoire ?<br />Cette analyse a nécessité la reconstitution de séries originales de stocks de capital privé et public. Ces indicateurs permettent ensuite de tester des fonctions de production régionale à trois facteurs (capital privé, emploi et capital public). La mobilisation des techniques applicables aux données de panel et l’introduction de fonctions de production de forme souple (forme trans-log) permet de mettre en évidence des effets propres à chaque région. On montre que, si, d’une manière générale et contrairement aux résultats américains, le capital public influence positivement la trajectoire de croissance de l’ensemble des régions, cet effet est d’autant plus important que la région connaît un niveau de développement économique élevé. De même, l’introduction de systèmes d’équations simultanées permet de mettre en évidence un effet d’éviction important. Cet impact négatif de l’imposition sur les trajectoires de croissance semble toutefois être plus que compensé par l’effet positif du capital public sur la production.<br />L’ensemble de nos résultats tend à conclure que le capital public joue bien sur les trajectoires de croissance des régions françaises, mais que les investissements publics favorisent plutôt les régions ayant déjà atteint un seuil de développement suffisant. Les investissement s publics semblent donc n’avoir que très peu d’effet correcteur des disparités régionales.</p></r2r:ml>

AB  - The analysis of maps and of their making uncovers territorial ideologies, as well as the sets of actors, political controversies and interests at stake. This article addresses the mapping of indigenous lands in Bolivia in the context of land reforms and politico administrative restructuration in favor of indigenous peoples since the 1990s. It deals in particular with the mapping of ayllus and markas (the name of Quechua and Aymara territories in the Bolivian Andes) produced for research and development aid projects. For the first time in the country's history, this mapping challenged hegemonic representations of national space. Despite the tendency of some documents to ruralize and essentialize indigenous territories, these maps sought to underline the complexity of present-day Andean territorialities (including territorial discontinuities, rural-urban relations, and dynamic boundaries). The production of these maps remained however subordinated to the financing and objectives of international development aid agencies, which used them for the control of regional shifts in population and war on drugs. Therefore, although the mapping of ayllus and markas contributed to controversies and debates on the internal decolonization of the Bolivian state and territory, they nonetheless confirmed the neocolonial dependence of the country towards the North.

AB  - Environmental economics can be applied to enhance areas and contribute to the conservation and protection of the environmental richness of ecosystems. It is a powerful tool that contributes in a general way to preserve nature, as well as planning and landing management. This research was developed on the Fundo El Carmen property, located in the city of Quilpué in Chile, with a main objective to value environmental goods and services. According to land planning instruments, in the results we present considerations oriented to environmental conservation at local and regional level. It is worth to note that for the Fundo El Carmen property the existing instruments did not deliver environmental conservation uses based on the proper identification of the highest value areas, consequently dismissing the biggest part of this environmental wealth.

A three stages development of this scientific movement (emergence, assertion and diversification)is tested through the study of a specific event: European colloquiums of Theoretical and Quantitative Geography. Two sets of data are used: the lists of communications and a set of fifty-five interviews of French-speaking European actors. We first analyze the quantitative evolution of communications from 1978 to 2011 and then the social networks corresponding to the authors, with a focus on their geographical settings. In the light of this formalization, the movement appears to develop from intra-laboratory collaborations to the emergence of cross-site and international cooperation.

AB  - The process underlying the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for large developments is often designed to allow opportunities for members of the public and NGOs to voice their opinions. This study describes the EIA process leading to a decision in the question of radioactive waste storage in Sweden. While it should be possible for a deciding authority to reject an EIA on the basis of non-involvement of the public or NGOs, this study illustrates the way in which the EIA process may be formed by different social norms that relate to the specific case. Authorities can be considered to represent a plan paradigm (by which the project itself as well as political decisions made about it are in focus), whereas many environmental organizations traditionally represent an environment paradigm, focusing on the risk of potentially ecologically harmful processes. These differences can also be seen as symptomatic of the inclusion of parts of an environment paradigm in legislation such as the Swedish Environmental Code.

AB  - Functional rehabilitation corresponds to intentional evolution of the functions of the building chosen by public actors in order to be revalorized and considered as tangible heritage. During all the 20th century, the use of monuments and traditional houses built in the heart of Uzbek pre-colonial urban areas are being changed, selected and invented by conquering States in order to answer ideological, economic and social needs. Since 1991, Uzbekistan is independent and functional rehabilitation establishes itself as a genuine tool for public city planning, working in the name of historic heritage preservation and, particularly, tourism development, gradually creating the urban space of Central Asia. But the reluctance of the locals, sensitive to the sacredness of the places, reminds us that they are holders of values in contradiction with those that the State proposes. The pre-colonial neighborhoods, considered as places of power and not as social spaces, are the mirror-image of political domination, which carries on.

AB  - The major idea of this paper is to simulate the construction of a segregate urban structure by means of spatial representations. To maintain such a project, the model must be quite simple because we wish to simulate and understand processes of production of space, their temporality and their dynamic influence on individual learning of space, rather than to reproduce a real situation. Furthermore, this work is included in a research project of UMR 6012, which aims to do a spatial analysis centred on the analysis of processes in a context of weak quantification. We use a multi-agent system in order to implement complex process: a spatial structure at macro level emerging from simple rules established at micro level and a feedback from macro to micro level. A model is constructed as following: Simulated households wander through the multi-agent universe to find the best place of residence according to constraints as their incomes or the prestige of places. They learn about this space by practice and, consecutively, construct varied representations that are going to participate in the construction of a collective representation of space. These two types of representation will contribute to help each household agent to find the best residential choice. Then, these choices will modify the characteristics of spaces and the new spatial structures will compel household agents in their practices of space, their individual representations and their choices. This feedback based on spatial representations contributes to a great extent to the construction of segregate urban forms.

The relative isolation of Kaliningrad from the rest of the Baltic region is caused by its particular status as a subject of disagreement between Russia and the European Union and by institutional policy. But there are also purely local reasons for that situation. The weak integration of Kaliningrad in Baltic exchange networks is also caused by the persistence of adverse geopolitical orientations in the local populations and persistent stereotypes in the public opinion.

AB  - Environmental aesthetics has mostly concerned itself not with changing environments, but with appreciating them. While making sense of how we do and ought to appreciate environments, both natural and built, is surely of value, aesthetics’ normative function can also contribute to debates about how we ought to intervene in sites that have been altered by human activity. In what follows the author seeks to offer some conceptual clarification, reserving the term restoration for only one particular sort of intervention, while introducing two new terms, transformation and renovation, for others. He draws his conclusion from Herman Prigann’s work in Gelsenkirchen (Germany’s Ruhr Valley): Skuplturenwald Rheinelbe (Rheinelbe Sculpture Wood).

AB  - The authors apply three methods of prospective modelling to high resolution georeferenced land cover data in a Mediterranean mountain area: GIS approach, generalized linear model and neural network. Land cover prediction to the latest known date is used to validate the models. In the frame of spatial-temporal dynamics in open systems results are encouraging and comparable. Correct prediction scores are about 73 %. The results analysis focuses on geographic location, land cover categories and parametric distance to reality of the residuals. Comparing the three models show the high degree of convergence and a relative similitude of the results obtained by the two statistical approaches compared to the GIS supervised model. Further steps are the application of the models to other test areas and the identification of respective advantages to develop an integrated model.

AB  - Since the 1980s, museums were gradually used within the framework of vast programs of urban regeneration initiated by the public authorities. In cities, heavily marked by industry, public authorities think that the opening of a museum on their territory could improve image and attract investors or companies. This article tries to assess the territorial impact of three museums located in the territories of old manufacturing areas in Europe : Imperial War Museum North (Manchester), the Museum of Design (Essen) and the Museum of Contemporary Arts or MAC' S (Mons). If museums enable the physical transformation of the city and the improvement of its image, the economic and social impacts of museums, chronically overdrawn institution, are very limited outside sectors of tourism and the culture. Museum completely doesn’t achieve its goal of democratization, neither inside its walls nor its direct urban environment.

AB  - To teach about France, the new geography curricula do not make any suggestion as far as work on a definition of France is concerned. This institutional abstention contrasts with the public expressions of territorial views, linked with the “national identity” theme. Nevertheless some teachers have chosen to address the question of a geographical definition of France, with their pupils as contributors. We consider these initiatives as opportunities to clear up what it is like, nowadays, to work as a geography teacher in high schools. Therefore we work with the sociology of engagement, and borrow from it the notion of “trial”, associated with taking up of a challenge. Last, an analysis of varied pupils works enables us to extend the definition of “trial”.

AB  - Every year, up to a fifth of Russian oil production is lost through leakage. The largest oil spills occur in the Russian North where permafrost is often present. Pipelines are subject to corrosion and cryogenic processes. The risk of rupture increases consequently. The oil spill monitoring is limited by the vastness and the frequent inaccessibility of the pipeline network and therefore, requires remotely sensed data. This work on Usinsk’s disaster, which occurred in 1994, aims at giving some low-level tools for analysing SAR data. Some disturbing factors such as the characteristics of the sensor, the sensor look direction, the topography and the speckle, make difficult the SAR data processing. The determination of the characteristics of the target depends on the knowledge of  these disturbing effects. This study shows the key role that these corrections play for the interpretation of multitemporal SAR backscattering. The method developed here for the multitemporal study of the Usinsk’s oil spill using 3 SAR images is discussed especially in terms of limits and possible uses as a routine.

AB  - Over the last twenty years, natural disasters have occupied an important place in our minds and in the media. These disasters have been considered in the past as the manifestation of divine anger or fate, but scientific progress has brought a rationalization in ways of thinking, making us less tolerant towards them. While many studies have focused on the characterisation of the physical processes that lead to these phenomena, few studies have sought to produce a global estimation of the exposure of the different countries across the world to natural hazards, exploring different approaches to vulnerability. The aim of our paper is to present a comparative study of risk exposure for each country, combining two approaches to their vulnerability (social and economic), and a probabilistic approach to hazards. This work highlights the fact that, using a social approach to vulnerability, great inequalities are observed between “rich” countries and “poor” countries where the latter present higher levels of exposure to risk, while using an economic approach to vulnerability, “rich” countries present the highest levels of exposure to risk.

AB  - Franchising has become a common strategy in the development of commercial networks. While management science has long been interested in the reasons for choosing franchising, geography has shown little interest in this particular form of network’s control and its impact on the spatial diffusion of these networks. The present paper analyses the reasons for an Indian company to expand its network of clinics through franchising and the consequences on its spatial distribution. Considering the effect of distance, what strategies are designed to control a network of franchises? Our methodology is based on semi-structured interviews with franchisees and management of the network coupled with the development of a database to study the spatial distribution of the network in India’s urban system. After an initial phase of rapid diffusion, network development was slowed down and later stagnated until the company finally dropped the franchise model for an internal growth model.

AB  - General access to automobile speed has enabled the separation between the places of life, in particular between the house and the place of work. In return, people are now addicted to this speed. Without speed, it is often impossible to perform the everyday life within the limits of a fixed travel-time. With the beginning of a stagnation or even a decrease in automobile speed, the urban functioning based on speed is more and more under tension and seems to be questioned in the short term. According to this assessment, the aim of this article is, in a first time, to identify using the example of the commuters to Avignon, where automobile speed dependency and tension in the mobility system are currently the highest, and thanks to GIS simulations, to see their probable evolution. In a second time, we aim to analyse the way speed dependency and tension are perceived and felt, to identify the strategies of the households to dodge this issue, in particular in terms of location choice.

AB  - It is a shared belief that Thomas Schelling’ model of segregation is only weakly affected by the underlying spatial structure, whatever its complexity. Such a conclusion is important from an urban planning perspective as it suggests that only a very restricted range of possible actions, if any, would be able to contribute limiting social segregation, unless individual preferences are significantly modified. Our own simulations show that, using appropriate graph-based spatial structures, one can reveal significant spatial effects and thus provide alternative planning insights. Cliques in networks indeed play a significant role, reinforcing segregation effects in Schelling’s model.

AB  - Cartography is indissociable from the process of State building, and is also closely tied in with the colonisation and pre-colonisation movement, most particularly in the 19th century. This analysis aims to examine the singular and founding contribution of Christian Tuxen Falbe, a ship’s captain in the Danish navy, the Danish Consul in Tunis, an expert in archaeology and a francophile, to whom we owe the first modern map of the city of Tunis in the early 1830s. Our analytical approach is guided by three related considerations: the way in which a foreigner is able to observe a territorialised social system in a culture that is different from his own; the practical conditions surrounding the application of cartographic ideas and governing the terms on which they are carried out, in particular the use of innovative techniques for the purpose of taking precise measurements; finally, the possible exploitation of this cartographic work by the French authorities who had just undertaken the colonisation of neighbouring Algeria at the time.

AB  - 3D diagrams that sum up the different kinds of landscape of the middle mountain plateau of Artense (French Massif Central) have been used to analyse landscape opinion of 5 farmers living in this area. 3 D drawing is a very good tool to help farmers explain how they use their plots and where they locate their different kinds of activity (grazing, hey production, manuring, bush clearing...). By this way, they are able to precise on the drawing the landscape elements (trees, stones, buildings) that have been missed or not well located. They can explain which kind of landscape they prefer. For the researcher, it is easer to separate what is determined by technical constraints and what is driven by non-economic factors (tradition, esthetic preferences,...) as far as the farmers' actions are concerned. To produce a method that could be used by non specialists, we have now to create automatic tools to produce these diagrams.

AB  - The aim of this article is to expose the context in which the mapping and the use of Geographical Information Systems within the field of crime and security expanded, and through different experiences show the various uses of maps. First will be considered the theoretical and the political context in which emerged the spatial approach of crime in France. The major turn took place in the early 80’s, when the object studied in criminology changed. Focus on crime as an act, instead of crime as a delinquent person, would allow geographers to develop a new approach based on explanations linked to the local conditions in which the delinquent act took place. However the use of maps and Geographical Information Systems within the field of crime and security expanded in France only in the latest 90’s. This development of spatial analysis of the delinquent act was linked with the situational crime prevention politics and the implementation of the “Contrats Locaux de Sécurité” (Local security contracts). Secondly, this article proposes a classification of maps uses in the security field considering three points of view : time, space and variety of data types. This typology is drawn from the authors various experiences in several French institutions and/or companies (INHES, RATP, SNCF). First of all, two operational uses are pointed out : knowledge and tactical use. Maps are here shown as a tool for local actors in order to assess their knowledge of the location of the delinquent acts and to organize the prevention and struggle against crime. Then two analytical uses are identified : strategic and political use. In these perspectives the map is on the one hand a decision-making tool and on the other hand a tool for evaluation of the efficiency of the actions implemented against crime.

AB  - The storm Xynthia occurred on the 28th of february 2010. It has been one of the most deadly seen on the French territory since several decades, with 47 victims, half of them found on the department of Vendée. We suggest a global interpretation of the reasons of the disaster on two adjoining districts, in the south of this department, La Faute-sur-mer and L’Aiguillon-sur-mer. We first focus on the different natural hazard’s characteristics: wind’s strength, role of the high tide’s coefficients, topography of the affected coastal areas, particularly on enclosed bays and estuaries, constitute risk factors which have add their effects in time and space, creating strong uplifts of sea level. We then analyse the crisis development, which partially explains the vulnerability of specific areas. Following, the first economic consequences on submerged lands are presented. Finally, we point the lack of risk assessment, resulting from long and carelessness practices on territorial management, to the detriment of natural processes knowledge and constraints, especially on potentially submerged areas. The lack of risk awareness has persisted with decisions taken locally, as well as at the highest national politic power.

The empirical study involves the use of ArgooMap to support users in an online public participatory decision-making process where the users are asked to find the “best” location for a new parkade in the downtown of Canmore, Alberta. The datasets on system usability have been collected automatically using UsaProxy software.We have found that there are significant differences in the system usability among the participants. The system usability is higher for users with GIS experience, higher education levels, and more web surfing experience. The findings provide insights for Web-PPGIS practitioners to advance such systems. It is noticed that the way the Web-PPGIS website was advertised may influence the results. An approach to avoid this problem is needed.

However, the purchase of such a model is not always possible for the expected localization and precision. We developed a very simple software allowing to build digital elevation models from altitude measurements taken on the terrain. The aim of this article is to describe the GenMNT software freely distributed on the Cybergeo web site. The user's manual comes with a quick and non-exhaustive presentation of the main methods of interpolation. The running of our program (based on the Delaunay triangulation) is described step by step. Lastly, we insist on the software simplicity and its interfacing with the Vistapro software to produce landscape 3D realistic views.

AB  - The French Ministry for Finances distributes on its Internet site the results of the collection of the Income tax (IRPP) on a very detailed level, the 36 500 communes of the country. The direct imposition of the households constituting a source of renewed information each year, and being extremely valuable, one seeks here to evaluate his capacity to express some of the features of the territorial organization of the country. To this end, four elementary indicators were calculated on each commune in order to bring an answer to the following questions: 1° Where does one pay the IRPP, knowing that hardly more than one household out of two pay this tax? 2° Which amount is really paid, measured by the load of imposition viewed as the relationship between the paid tax and the taxable tax income? 3° Which are the differences in average income between the declared wages and the pensions? 4° Which the weight of the pensions in the whole of the incomes? The analysis of a series of thematic maps and a synthesis in the form of a multivariate classification makes it possible to bring a particular lighting to these questions usually put in socio-economic terms and still seldom in geographical terms. These maps visualize marked geographical differences which have a relationship with the economic activities, the urbanization, the migrations… i.e. with the strong structures of French space.

AB  - We describe here an original methodology for building an harmonized data base relative to urban populations in United States, from 1790 to 2000 (one point every 10 years, i.e. 22 dates). This method is based on two theoretical principals. The first one consists in the using of a space-time referential in order to build agglomerations, by aggregating cities or towns from 1870 (inside a one-hour limit at each period of time). The second consists in the using of a functional approach of urban entities as soon as possible, i.e. from 1940. We have two different types of functional areas in our data base, metropolitan and micropolitan. The metropolitan areas definition has changed several times (Standard Metropolitain Areas in 1949, Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas in 1958 and Statistical Metropolitan Areas in 1983). We elaborate different criteria to correct some perimeters, in order to obtain a temporal coherent trajectory of populations and surfaces. As these metropolitan areas are very few (less than 400 in the 2000 census), we use the definition of micropolitan areas (given in 2000 by the Census Board) to build such areas in prior decades, up to 1940. The different maps that are built from our harmonized data base (urban frontier, urban patterns and surfaces) give a global and coherent vision of the U. S. urbanization through the last two centuries. Lastly, we compare urban growth and inequality size indicators computed with our data base to other computed with the Census definition or with other data bases built by researchers. The results are sometimes very different, which confirm the major impact of the delineation methodology in urban growth measures.

Their numbers  evolved over periods of a few decade  depending of demographic requirements. We are looking for the spatial distribution of these canals to characterize a fractal geometry. This approach  is close to the one developed by urbanists to study the communication networks in and around cities. The distribution of the land surfaces must be characterized in the same way to check the good matching against the irrigation networks.

AB  - This study focuses on various validation and error analysis techniques that are based on map comparisons. After a literature review, authors apply these techniques to analyze the accuracy of LUCC models in terms of quantity, pixel by pixel correctness and LUCC components such as persistence and change. In addition, the fidelity of the spatial patterns and the congruency of the simulation maps from different modelling tools are tested. Finally, an error analysis is conducted that focuses on the magnitude of allocation errors and the magnitude of errors in predicted land use / cover classes. In addition, the impact of training dates on Markov chain predicted LUCC is analyzed. Mentioned techniques of validation and error analysis are illustrated by modelling LUCC of a small study area in the Eastern Pyrenees (France), where current LUCC are driven by spontaneous reforestation, decreasing pastureland and minimal anthropogenic disturbance. This very simple data set is used with three different tools (CA-Markov, LCM and Dinamica Ego) that represent commonly used modelling approaches and there methodological characteristics are highlighted. Applied to this specific dataset, contrasting results occur for different software programs that can help users choose an appropriate modelling approach according to specific model objectives.

AB  - Borders in Central Asia became international in 1991, although their existence and definition had often been controversial. The post-Soviet states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) have now adopted these borders and use them as a tool to build their territorial independence. Borders have been equipped and functionalized, so that they have become key territorial structures in the regional space. In that way, they contribute to marking out national territories and consolidating states. The enforcement of these new borders has cut off some areas and divided others, which threatens the cohesion of national space but also encourages the emergence of national territoriality. This unprecedented compartmentalisation of Central Asia raises questions about how nations and regions cohabit and highlight the original links between globalisation and deregionalisation.

AB  - The Portland Metropolitan Area, OR, is known for introducing growth boundaries to contain urban sprawl in the United States of America. This controversial policy is charged of pushing up housing price and intensifying road congestion. This paper updates the debate by examining the existing empirical evidences up to 2010 in comparison with other metropolitan areas where urban growth is less regulated. Portland’s regional planning’s results are mixed. It contains urban growth efficiently, but it also has unwanted side-effects that support the Conservative’s critics of regional planning.

AB  - The thermal infrared satellite images can be employed on the conurbations remote sensing; and springboard in the study of the urbanization processes. Whether it is with NOAA 14 AVHRR or LANDSAT 5 TM infrared thermal images taken at dawn period all allow recognise at various levels of geographic analyses the concentrations of built areas and to extract different morphologic, social and demographical indicators: densities and morphologies of built areas, thresholds of concentrations of populations. Their types of information are obtained by the confrontation of the land surface temperatures maps produced from AVHRR thermal Infrared images with the maps of distribution of the Moroccan population; the TM thermal infrared sensor with the ground field reality and the Kenitra plan of town planning. Their difference of spatial resolution (1.1x1.1 Km with AVHRR and 120x120 m with TM) allowing respectively an analysis the levels intra urban and regional of the littoral urbanization of the Moroccan Atlantic Metropolis (MAM). The equivalence between the various results stemming from the remote sensing thermal infrared and socio demographical data processing shows additional character of geographic information produced by remote sensing.

AB  - Downstream of the confluence with the Allier River, the Middle Loire River is characterized by a fluvial bed with semi-embanked channel. The wooded islands are ubiquitous throughout the river’s landscape, and are areas of active vegetalization in the fluvial bed. The aim of the present paper is to provide an update to the current knowledge of these fluvial forms: their formation and rate of development. Recent development of anabranching in the Loire river is related to the co-evolution of societal uses, and the morphology of the river bed. The main channel of the river has continued to migrate laterally within its area of mobility. This situation has led to the development of large areas of sedimention on the biggest islands, which play a major role in the retention of sediments, and the sedimentary imbalance of the river. The development of anabranching reveals fluvial readjustments, and the islands are excellent bio-geomorphological indicators. Our study provides additional input to current research on the anastomosis of rivers with islands in Western Europe.

AB  - The concept of greenways becomes relevant also in town and challenges researchers and practitioners. We asked about the construction of this field and its disciplinary origins. For that we have found the scientific literature on the subject over the past three decades and developed a bibliographic corpus has identified the main lexical richness. Our results show that ecosystem services and the inclusion of urban biodiversity increasingly structure the scientific field of urban greenway. Issues of ecological connectivity and reports of humans with nature in cities gradually enrich the issue of green belt. The latest writings particularly emphasize the origin and the multidisciplinary construction of the term, combining ecological, geographical and sociological notions.

This article asks whether a tsunami warning system is needed in the Indian Ocean where the probability to experience a similar catastrophe is very scarce. In addition, other alternatives including land use planning and education focused on tsunami risk management are presented. Their application could strongly reduce financial and human losses if such hazard had to occur again.

AB  - After first examining the issues in visualising individual event histories, a description of a new method for viewing such data is given. The technique displays an event history as a pencil-like multi-faceted object in three-dimensional space, with changes of state being represented by changes in colour, texture or height along the length of the pencil. Viewing a single history allows a detailed examination of an individual's life events, and allows the relationship between changes of state in many variables to be examined. The extension of these ideas to viewing populations of event histories is then described. The Lexis diagram provides a suitable paradigm and is used to position the pencils in space. The resulting graphical representation is closely related to the ideas of Bertin, but with some important differences.

The analysis of these regional maps allows us to identify some spatial structures specific to the French regionalist imaginary. Some geographical areas appear repeatedly and seem to be obvious while other areas look more uncertain. Mapping these regional divisions offers a general prism proper to question the new regional units proposed by the president of the French Republic in a bill submitted to Parliament in June 2014.

This short contribution debates on whether eco-neighborhoods have been initiating an urban paradigm shift or whether something in their “genetic” makeup actually dooms them to an inevitable return of the same. It draws from a review of specialized literature and from actual experiences, mostly Swiss and French.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to show the interest, in a place such as the Thessaloniki Plain, to combine the geomorphological study and the palaeoenvironmental approach in order to solve questions of historical geography. The careful scrutiny of literary sources indicates a fast stranding of a shallow marine cove it doesn’t allow reconstructing precisely the rhythms of deltaic progradation since Antiquity. For the last 1500 years, the study is more complicated since there is an important lack of documents mentioning the landscape’ evolution during the Byzantine and the Ottoman periods. From the 19th century, traveller’s descriptions and detailed maps provide new information. The lack of descriptions for certain periods obliges to lead a palaeonevironmental reconstruction of the landscape. For the Thessaloniki Plain, eight boreholes have been drilled between the ancient city of Pella, former capital of the Macedonian Kingdom, and the present-day shoreline. The chronostratigraphic evidence allowed to redefine the different steps of the outbuilding of the largest deltaic complex of Greece.

AB  - In projects of urban sustainability, the uses of assessment by indicators are growing. Since 2007, Paris city council established a dashboard of indicators based on a guidebook for sustainable town planning so called “Un aménagement durable pour Paris”. This dashboard allows assessing urban planning projects, in order to increase the efficiency in terms of sustainability of urban operations. The aim is to progress towards sustainability thanks to this experiment. Based on the Parisian experience, the article enhances the necessity of a debate on the relevance of the assessment by indicators in sustainability. The answer proposed here is to fix the conditions of a specific culture of sustainability assessment and highlights some questions about links between scales, times and stakeholders.

AB  - The first "scientific" map of the Western Sahara was made by the Geographical Service of the Spanish Army between 1943 and 1949, which thereby recovered a leading role in cartography following allocation of work on the National Topographical Map of Spain to a civilian body from 1870. It also represented an opportunity to mitigate the isolation of the Franco dictatorship, by linking its creation with the 1:1,000,000 international map. Making it involved going over the desert inch by inch, since other means had proved unusable: because Spain's isolation made it impossible to buy film for a photogrammetric flight, because of the distortions caused to theodolites and sights by the atmosphere and light refraction, and because of the mechanical action of dust in topographical instruments. In the desert, particularly harsh in the “hamada” and Tiris areas, the selfless help of the Saharawis was crucial for the achievement of the cartographic project. Through poetic games which precisely depict desert landscapes, they could call on a mental map which was essential both on topographical survey trips and during the office meetings dedicated to the transcription on the map of their placenames and of geographical features generic names.

AB  - Due to the recent outbreak of SARS and the danger of pandemic Bird Flu, the ability to strengthen health surveillance and disease control is a growing need among governments. The development of the Canadian Geospatial Data Infrastructure (CGDI) has shown great potential in many industries such as emergency management, public health, disaster relief, environmental impact assessment, transportation, and land information systems. In this paper, our aims are to use the CGDI and to identify its usability in supporting online health mapping. To identify the usability of the CGDI for health mapping, we employed nine usability metrics. We also designed an architecture based on the CGDI to support the basic functions for health mapping, and implemented an infectious disease simulation for New Brunswick and Maine. Within the CGDI framework, this research enabled cross-border health data visualization, integration, sharing, and exploring the spatio-temporal trends of an infectious disease outbreak through thematic maps. Based on the experience of the developers and the feedback from users, an evaluation of the usability matrix with the CGDI components (technical standards, national framework data, enabling technologies, and common data policies) was explored using this cross-border health mapping application. The use of the CGDI in health applications has a great potential in supporting effective and secure health data sharing and integration. Enrichment of the CGDI would further facilitate the data sharing and improve decision making efficiency and effectiveness.

AB  - In this paper we present the digitalisation of the map of the vegetation of France edited by the CNRS in 64 sheets between 1947 and 1991. The geographical covers and the databases built during this work are gathered in a geographical database called “Base de Données Géographique de la VÉGétation de la France” (BDGveg_FR). The main covers show respectively the vegetation succession stages, as a georeferenced scan, at 1/200,000, and the harmonised map of the potential vegetation, in a vector format, at 1/1,000,000. The harmonised map of the potential vegetation is linked with a national 6-level typology synthesised from the keys of the 64 sheets. Possible uses of the BDGveg_FR are shown with some examples on the determination of the factors of vegetation distribution (altitude, geology, soil and climate) by intersecting it with others sources of geographical data (digital elevation model, vector covers at 1/1,000,000 of soil and geology). The BDGveg_FR is actually complementary to the other databases on the vegetation of France presently available thanks to its period of time, its local and national scales, its exhaustive cover and its information on the plant associations. It can be used to assess the impact of global changes (e.g. climate, atmospheric pollution) on ecosystems.

AB  - This study analyzes the spatial evolution of the port of Dakar over a little more than a century (1900-2009) and considers its linkages with political, economic and territorial issues since its inception. Spatial analysis was used to follow the transformation of the port area at a micro-local scale; it provides a few cues about how the port is linked to other scales. The space-time analysis showed that port management could somehow adapt to changing maritime traffic through spatial management and logistic arrangements. The extension phase which was initially linked to the port’s call function, then to the country’s commercial and industrial development, involved an extension of the port’s domain over the sea, because of an urban influence that had soon become a major spatial constraint. The specialization phase focusing on containerization occurred only in 2000, 25 years after the first container shipments to West Africa. But the port is now at a critical point. Indeed, if the space has been occupied at more than 90% capacity over the last decade, its current configuration does not allow it to support the future growth of maritime flows. The option of embankments, which has been the response to the congestion of terminals, doesn’t offer guarantees for the security of naval operations. This announces a dissociation phase, with the displacement of the ore terminals out of the city and reuse of the freed space. But this costly option calls for a strategy that is coherent with the country’s economic development, and the involvement of a diversity of investors.

AB  - After reviewing the main methods of image analysis applied to urban areas, an approach is presented to determine an urban outline by integrating the zones of mixed land use to those of the built-up urban area. This method of delimitation has the advantage that it can be applied to any urban settlement and consequently makes possible a comparison of urban structures and dynamics in different regional or national contexts.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to define “eco-frontiers,” both theoretically and methodologically. Our argument is illustrated and detailed by examples taken in South Africa (Wild Coast). “Eco-frontier” is a tri-dimensional idea. Firstly, it is an existing notion, normalised, used and instrumentalised by groups of stakeholders like environmental NGOs. Secondly, it a psycho-mental and spatial representation conveyed by a westernised imaginary of nature. Finally, eco-frontier is also a spatial category that can be understood through different parameters. Transversally, eco-frontiers are real or mental spaces marked by strong ecological and aesthetic values which are coveted by various stakeholders. Many types of ecological appropriations imply different conflicting categories of eco-frontiers: e.g., wilderness, landscape, and extractive use. Eco-frontiers are transitory and temporary spaces characterised by specific geographical parameters: a pioneer gateway opened to an isolated and low population density area, weakly bounded by unattainable limits; an ecological appropriation done virtually or physically by groups of eco-settlers; and a group of local inhabitants offering mixed reactions. Eco-frontiers create very complex situation for stakeholders disputing different legitimacies based on different uses of ecosystems, resources, or land. Winning ecological appropriations tends to shape new spatial patterns: e.g., conservation enclave, urban sprawl (tourism activity or peri-urbanisation), or wasteland. The South African example (the Xolobeni area, Wild Coast) illustrates a “wilderness versus extractive” eco-frontier with a detailed focus on environmental NGOs. This example is used to understand what are the different categories of eco-settlers which can be generalised.

AB  - The very first doctorate theses in French regional geography in regard to Far East regions, The Thanh Hoá Geographical Study of an Annamite Province from Charles Robequain, and The Peasants of the Tonkin Delta from Pierre Gourou, were published respectively in 1929 and 1936. This article deconstructs the interpretation and the rhetoric of the two discourses which are underlying the two works. It compares these with other representative discourses of the 1920s and 1930s, and questions the relevance and approach of each of the two authors. It highlights the way two geographers belonging to the French Empire, with a similar university background and both working in the Indochinese field, have constructed two dissimilar geographical discourses, while contributing their expertise in the constitution of a French as well as Vietnamese corpus of knowledge that describes the peasant structures and dynamics.

AB  - This article seeks to assess the geographical impact of the Venezuela’s Bolivarian revolution. It compares the rhetoric of the revolution with empirical facts by studying regional imbalances and socialist programs implemented in the state of Zulia in both rural an urban areas. The concepts of spatial justice and social justice are used to try to understand how this new socialist geography can contribute to the country’s development. Despite the advances of the revolution, the oil rent-seeking capitalism heritage of the 20th century continues. If we can observe a greater territorial and social integration of the poor and excluded people, which is sometimes more symbolic than real, this has not really generated a greater spatial and social justice to them. This is true within the selected definition of the justice, at the present time and within the studied geographical areas.

AB  - During the 1990s, ethnic conflicts in the Western Balkans have led to a fragmentation and a recombination of territories and populations mainly around the major ethnic groups. Based on a consociational approach and a pragmatic position of bringing the war to an end, the International Community interventions that followed have reinforced the ethnicisation of territories, societies and politics. While there is much research being conducted to highlight the limits of such an approach, there is still too little work devoted to possible alternatives. The aim of this paper is to theoretically and critically discuss to what extent new political and social dialogue may emerge in former Yugoslavia through cross-border cooperation (promoted in particular by the EU) and to consider the possible links of this with interethnic reconciliations.

AB  - Landscape simulation can be a good means to understand the observed evolutions to then identify the factors generating the changes. We have worked on the evolution of the land use in a " commune " in the chain of the Puys, by using a model dealing with the ecological growth of vegetation that agricultural practices hinder. The discrete event simulations enable to study long-term evolutions and take space aspects into account, but farm modelling is still simplistic. We have then developed a multi-agent model that enables us to take into account the interactions between the farms subjected to competition and synergy. This work corroborates that a multi-agent modelling is quite adapted to study the influence of social relationship on the territory and then on the landscape. In this presentation, we also show how a multi-agent model can be integrated to discrete event simulations.

AB  - Postulates of W. Christallers central-place theory are discussed with an introduction of a new sixth postulats. Under consideration are specific cases of settlement systems which can not be described by the apparatus of the classical central-place theory. It is shown that besides external causes responsable for the deformation of Christaller grid (anisotropy of the territory, etc.) there are some inner, immanent causes of it which have spontaneous nature. The paper formulates basics of the relativist version of the central-place theory, introduces notions of "the degree of stability of urban settlement systems" and “isostatic equilibrium" (as an attractor). It presents the results of analysis of the degree of stabilite of settlement systems of Estonia, Armenia, Georgia, and Central Russia. It is substantiated that it is possible to create a theory of the Great Unification by applying the synthetic approach to both the relativist central-place theory and phasic conceptions of spatial development.

AB  - Since the advent of full participatory democracy in South Africa in April 1994, a fundamental revision of the norms, values and practices of urban management has occurred. A central feature of this is expressed commitment to greater transparency and public participation in decision-making and project execution. Manegerial practice has moved from being essentially technocratic and control-oriented to more pluralistic and development-oriented. The previously disenfranchised and largely impoverished sectors of the community have moved from exclusion and confrontation toward greater involvement and empowerment. This has not been without problems however. The current status of community participation in Cape Town is reviewed and explored against a theoretical model. The conclusion drawn is that, political impediments notwithstanding, a considerable energy and momentum has been generated at local level in civil society towards the goal of improvement in social and living environments in the city.

AB  - Within a Network of cities, urban growth process depends on two spatial processes at two different scales. First, urbanization grows by consuming land reserves (urban sprawl) and increasing urban density. The second depends on the extension of the network of cities induced by mobility to find open spaces to urbanize. The aim of this paper is to construct an index of urban pressure able to estimate the potential spaces of urbanization. We construct this index using spatial variables that incorporate accessibilities and land uses. The pressure index is used to assess the vulnerabilities caused by the growth of metropolitan sprawl.

AB  - A survey was carried out among twenty professionals playing a role in the land management to understand better the social representations of the Swiss Jura landscape. In order to let the interviewees freely express their conception of landscape, it was decided not to use any type of graphical support but to ask only open questions. Some elements of a definition found in the answers shed light on the theoretical bases of landscape assessment. The results showed different levels of perception. A visual approach focusing on the relationship between relief and land-use appears as a fundamental topic. On more analytical grounds, the importance attached to the economic, sociocultural and environmental stakes determines the basis of the value judgement. These findings allowed landscape representation models to be drawn from the interviewees’ points of view, explaining how the landscape is conceived and what criteria are considered relevant for assessing it in the social groups. The next step will be to further define quantitative as well as qualitative indicators to be integrated in a methodology for diagnosing landscape using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

The present article puts forward a methodological approach to define and characterize commercial centres within urban area. On the one hand we aim to examine the relevance of classical models of city centre retailing. On the other hand we aim to point out what happened to the geography of retailing within Inner Paris after three decades of spatial restructuring at the metropolitan level. Results show that the spatial structure of retailing remains very hierarchical. We also find out a series of gradients and a nested hierarchy of centres. Despite the emerging polycentric spatial organisation of city regions, Berry and Davies’ theoretical models appear to remain valid when analyzing city centres retailing.

It aims to provide a better basis for integrating territories during the process of exploring the future through the use of various methods. This approach goes beyond considering the spatial dimension as a simple support to render the possible futures of territories. Three fields of research have contributed to its emergence: the companion modelling, the prospective and the modelling of land use and land cover changes.

AB  - The valleys of Merapi volcano are regularly filled with thick pyroclastic and volcaniclastic deposits, characterised by a large grain-size distribution, from fine ash to boulders. An important but quite informal mining of these materials (sands and blocks) has developed, and has become widespread around the volcano. It is now an essential activity in the spatial organisation of Merapi volcano, and seems to play a major role in the local socio-economic pattern. Volcanic hazards such as pyroclastic flows or lahar flows produce a substantial resource which endangers people who dig these deposits. But the important benefits related to this activity encourage people to work in hazard-prone areas. Moreover, at a broader scale, block and sand mining generates many interactions and retroactions which seem to be a real factor of vulnerability for Merapi’s surrounding communities. Thus, this activity has to be taken into account when conducting risk and vulnerability studies around the volcano. They also help to understand better how people live and work there, and why most of them choose to stay and work even during intense volcanic activity.

AB  - The railway station of Canfranc, located on the line of the western transpyrénéen (opened in 1928) did not know the traffic waited during its building. Symbol of whole country liking to show its dynamism and its modernity by opening with Europe, this vast international station made the object of a considerable architectural and urbanistic plan not to say immoderate with regard to actual railroad traffic (abolished quoted France since 1970). Having lost in a landscape of high mountain, the second biggest railway station of Europe represents a special heritage for numerous reasons, particularly because the rail landscape which comes to the visitor is absolutely unique. The Spanish actors concentrate on created it of emblematic building of the passengers today. The rest of hold is earned a little more every day by the abandonment and the waste land and urgent front to be transformed into urban space (according to the plan of discreet architect). This choice of a break-up programmed by rail hold, and by to a great extent not rail réaffectation, answers certainly the wish to promote this place but destroys what could constitute the vastest conservatory of the history of the western railway.

AB  - Spatial data quality has been attracting much interest. Much of the problem lies in the degree to which current data structures are unable to model the real world and the way imperfections in the data may propagate during analyses and cast doubt on the validity of the outcomes. Much of the research has concentrated on the quantitative accuracy of spatial data, the derivation of indices and their propagation through analyses. Geographical data invariably includes an element of interpretation for which linguistic hedges of uncertainty may be generated. The paper presents a new technique of handling such expressions in a GIS through fuzzy expectation - intuitive probabilities linked to stylized fuzzy sets. By using fuzzy expectation as linguistic building blocks, many of the difficulties in using fuzzy set descriptors in GIS have been overcome. The stylized fuzzy sets can be propagated using Boolean operators to give a resultant fuzzy set which can be ‘translated’ back into a linguistic quality statement. For the first time, linguistic criteria of fitness-for-use can be derived for GIS outputs regardless of the language being used.

AB  - Vulnerability in an urban milieu is generally considered through population indicators, such as the level of poverty, the level of education, etc. Nonetheless, these represent but one aspect of urban vulnerability. Seeking to evaluate the vulnerability of elements considered essential to the operating of the city allows us to complete the approach and to reveal other facets of vulnerability that are frequently overlooked. By looking at the vulnerability of water provision in the agglomeration of La Paz, the analysis emphasises the weaknesses of this element that is essential to urban functioning. It also points out how this vulnerability can be transmitted to other essential elements which need water to operate (health centres, inhabitants, etc.) and so can provoke crises. The analysis of vulnerability makes it possible to highlight the points of the system provision that must be improved in a perspective of preventative planning.

AB  - In this paper, the author adopt a time-geography approach to examine the temporal variation of urban density by analysing spatial load changes at different times of the day at the communal and community level. The evolution of means of transport coupled with the abandon of the notion of direct proximity to the urban dwelling place provide the basis for this new approach to the study of urban densities. The shift towards spatial specialisation within cities has lead to radical changes in the forms of urban mobility. In just a few generations, cities, formerly highly concentrated centres of population, have evolved into diffuse urban expanses. As a result, the intangible bonds between the dwelling place and the city have progressively disappeared giving way to a temporally-biased perception of urban space determined by existing methods of transport. Density variations have thus been used to measure urban mobility and transport requirements.

AB  - This paper explores the public nature of Times Square's physical and represented (TV, internet, press) spaces through an analysis of the techniques used by Senegalese male peddlers to sell souvenirs to the visiting tourists. Whereas a number of scholars denounce the Disneyfication of Times Square, in other words its privatization, the observation of the peddlers shows that there is an almost self-regulated social order of the flow escaping the control of the pseudo-public institution in charge of Times Square, the Business Improvement District. On the other hand, the difficulties encountered by the vendors also reveal another Times square, less public, constituted by the accumulation of images captured by the finance and media companies settled in the office towers. This "clean and safe" pseudo-private space (Mitchell and Staeheli 2006) cannot tolerate the presence of the vendors, thus pushing them to the blind spots of the site. It nevertheless relies on the dynamics of the flow, thus preserving a place for the vendors and the public nature of the physical space of Times Square. But how long can this compromise work?

AB  - The frontier which currently divides Romania and Ukraine is due to the soviet decision to annex in 1940 North Bukovina and Bassarabia. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the romanians leaders tried to assert their rights to these lands, from which they had been despoiled. The question of the minorities was still at the centre of the debate, even if the real stake in the regular romanian-ukrainian negotiations seems actually to have been the “Snakes’ Island”, an unoccupied sandbank off the Danube Delta, which is close to territories of important oil resources.

The proposed models integrate uncertainty, spatial interaction among a limited number of key sub-spaces and the evolution of the spatial system over time. This modeling approach is applied to scenario building for future development of the French Riviera metropolitan area. The limits of the proposed methodology are finally discussed, as well as its potential of integration in strategic planning and its perspectives of future development.

AB  - “Trame verte” (greenway) has become one “star” of the Grenelle laws. However, the concept is not new as evidenced by the multiplicity of legal instruments (sometimes old) that may regulate and plan the components of a greenway (I). However, the local example studied, the Angers Loire Métropole urban region, demonstrates how difficult it is to connect the diversity of national and international tools to ground truth at the communal planning level (II). This shift from global to local can draw some lessons for a better consideration of greenways, but it also raises some questions that the future regional ecological corridors Grenelle plan will probably have to cope with (III).

AB  - The urban and suburban development is one of the most under-estimated causes of soil destruction. By using tools to characterize land use in the French metropolitan territory, the aim of this paper is to assess the phenomenon of artificialization and its impacts on soils and their environments. Three independent databases for evaluating soil artificialization were used : the TERUTI land use survey (SCEES), the urban area zoning database (ZAU-Insee) and Corine land cover (service de l’observation et des statistiques). The intersection between the different land use databases and the soil map of France at the scale of 1/1 000 000 (Inra, 1998) allowed us to characterize which soil types and which environments are most affected by artificialization. According to the three databases, the most threatened soils globally remain unchanged, with an artificialization rate above 50% of their surface : HISTOSOLS, FLUVIOSOLS dystriques, FLUVIOSOLS eutriques, NEOLUVISOLS, REDUCTISOLS and VERTISOLS. This list is completed by salty soils, according to the TERUTI land use survey. ANDOSOLS, PODZOSOLS, BRUNISOLS DYSTRIQUES, ALOCRISOLS, VERTISOLS and RANKOSOLS seem to be less affected by artificialization. The impact of artificialization was also assessed for each type of environment. The soils are grouped in three main types of environments : cultivated lands, forests and wetlands. The increase of artificialization highly affects wetlands, an environment for which there are major issues in terms of biodiversity, water quality and prevention of natural hazards.

AB  - A working definition of a complex system is of an entity which is coherent in some recognizable way but whose elements, interactions, and dynamics generate structures admitting surprise and novelty which cannot be defined a priori. Complex systems are therefore more than the sum of their parts, and a consequence of this is that any model of their structure is necessarily incomplete and partial. Models represent simplifications of a system in which salient parts and processes are simulated and given this definition, many models will exist of any particular complex system. In this paper, we explore the impact of complexity in validating models of such systems. We begin with definitions of complexity, complex systems, and models thereof. We identify the key issues as being concerned with the characterization of system equilibrium, system environment, and the way systems and their elements extend and scale. As our perspective on these issues changes, then so do our models and this has implications for their testing and validation. We develop these, introducing changes in the meaning of validity posed by the use to which such models are to be put in terms of their users. We draw these ideas together as conclusions about the limits posed to prediction in complex systems. We illustrate our arguments using various examples from the field of urban systems theory and urban science.

AB  - The appearance of S-curve in the treatment of a space-time data is very often associated to a spatial diffusion. This systematic assimilation of the S-curve to the logistic model is misleading, , it leads to an amalgam which masks the diversity of mathematical models to capture really different phenomena of diffusion. The aims of this paper is to show some examples of diffusion which are all expressed by a S-curve but which correspond in fact to different models. Three models are presented: - logistic model is the most usually used by geographers despite his independency from space. We compare here a spatialized and probabilistic version of this model with its analytical and deterministic form. - as opposed to the first one, the front diffusion model imposes a strong space constraint, the contact being prevalent in the diffusion. In this case, diffusion is not subjected to a global constraint but depends on the length and on the form of the front at any moment. - the third model is composite, it proceeds of the logistic growth forced by local constraints and of propagation of a front. These three models are studied in their analytical forms and are compared with their dynamic simulated. We show a continuity between these 3 models entering within the framework of a broader class of parameterized models. Moreover their combinations give an expansion of other models making it possible to apply to a great variety of problems.

AB  - The current urban world is basically different from the rural world. Indeed the quite systematic enforcement of the Chart of Athens has increased a lot the number of districts without any soul. The young living in those districts are thus facing great difficulties for building their own identity in so far as this environment does not give any framework. As a result, they get difficulties to find out a balanced way of live enabling them to get success at school. Hence, the "Education nationale" in France has to develop a cultural policy which can cope with those difficulties. After processing the legitimity and the goals of the cultural action of the "education nationale" in France, we will show its shapes and means. Eventually, it will be interesting to try to evaluate this policy.

AB  - This paper presents an approach of potential groundwater capture of Piton de la Fournaise volcano in the Reunion Island (France - Indian Ocean). Different methods exist to capture groundwater resources. To further the traditional method of vertical wells, the horizontal wells could also used as volcanic structure is well adapted to them. But, at the Reunion island, there is no example of a horizontal well because of the doubt existing on the horizontal distance of the aquifer. The method developed in this study is therefore original because it gives a way to calculate this distance for the entire massif. In this article, the method to calculate vertical and horizontal accessibilities in a relational database is explained. Unfortunately, the result coverage gives data on the accessibility. It is therefore necessary to define criteria to select the most productive areas. The results of this study demonstrated that it is possible to calculate the vertical and horizontal accessibilities on the whole massif in coupling hydrogeologic modeling and GIS.

AB  - Gottmann's geographic literature spans over sixty years of activity -- between 1933 and 1994 -- and is composed of almost 400 titles, about twenty of which are books. Published mostly in French and English, his writings were translated in fourteen languages including Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Tamil, Dutch, Turkish, Slovenian, Japanese, Polish, Yiddish, German and modern Greek. Jean Gottmann's first official bibliography -- covering his writings between 1933 and 1984 -- was published in Patten, J. (ed.), 1983 in The Expanding City, Essays in honour of Professor Jean Gottmann, London-New York Academic Press, pp. xvii-xxxv. The same bibliography is entirely reprinted, with just one addition relative to 1983, in his volume of the same year: The Coming of the Transactional City, printed in College Park by the University of Maryland's Institute for Urban Studies. A selection of his publications dedicated to urban geography between 1949 and 1987 can be found in Jean Gottmann and Robert Harper, 1990, Since Megalopolis, the Urban Writings of Jean Gottmann, Baltimore and London, The Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 269-280. Thanks to the partial opening of the Fond Gottmann, housed at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France Département des Cartes et Plans it was possible to verify his entire bibliography on the same notebook where Gottmann kept note of his own publications. Finally, the information in this bibliograhy was compared to the one available from the indexes of those thematic volumes that are selections of previously published essays from different scientific journals. In particular Etudes sur l'Etat d'Israel (1958), Essais sur l'aménagement de l'espace habité (1966), La cité invincible (1983) e Since Megalopolis (1990). We would like to thank Jean-Yves Sarazin, curator of the Fond Gottmann at the Bibliothéque Nationale de France in Paris, for his kind re-reading of the complete bibliography.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the changes in plant cover after the recent glacier retreat,in an alpine environment. The selected study site in Savoie in the French Alps (2502-2509m asl), belonging to the European network Natura 2000, provides favourable conditions for the study due to the flat glacier foreland, where the glacier did not advance since the Little Ice Age. Data collected from 110 botanical plots were correlated with dated glacial and proglacial landforms. Species diversity has been analysed using the Shannon-Weaver index, the Grime classification, and the uncommon species described in the European list of Natura 2000 European Network. Classical and multivariate analyses have been made to determine the impact of the glacial retreat on the biodiversity variation. We show that the changes in species richness and vegetation cover were related to the distance from the glacier front. The biodiversity index was less than 2.5 near the glacier but above 4 at the furthest point. The highest plant diversity, however, was observed at an intermediate position, where competitive and pioneer plants were equally represented in the field. This location, concurrently, showed the highest heterogeneity in the activity of periglacial processes. It seems that the most heterogeneous and disturbed soils, due to inherited deposits and currently active periglacial processes, are responsible for an increase in biodiversity.

AB  - While risk perception studies have flourished in an expanded interdisciplinary field since the early works of geographers and psychologists in the 1960s, the wide array of risk perception drivers remain controversial. This paper proposes to shift from location-specific approaches to a space-based framework in order to develop the relationship between risk perception, residential segregation and exposure to hazards. The data is provided by a spatially and socially representative survey (n = 621) carried out in Bucharest, Romania. Bucharest is a medium-size European capital particularly exposed to floods, earthquakes, hazardous activities and pollution. Rapid deindustrialization and the enduring memory of the last major earthquakes provided a good context in which to develop time and space dimensions. Data are used to compare three different models: the aggregate ratings of extreme events, the significance of individual differences, and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to place emphasis both on differences between rated phenomena and between respondents. Results are mapped and compared with official risk delineation maps in order to highlight those neighbourhoods where there are considerable disparities between perceived risk and assessed risk. These comparisons establish the relevance of the space-based framework. They are also confirming most classical hypotheses and revealing the systematically strong explanatory power of space. This implies that random sample surveys as well as location-specific studies may have been systematically biased. The strong spatial oppositions in risk perception are explained by residential segregation and the respondents’ environment. Implications for risk perception studies and risk communication are then discussed.

AB  - 30 years ago Jacques Bertin launched the theory of graphic semilogy. This theory has formed one of the pillars in cartographic education and in practical cartographic work. The objective of this paper is not to review this fruitful adoption but rather to draw attention to an inconsistency between Bertin’s term organising level and the corresponding concept from the literature of statistics, measurement system. The fact that the former is three-levelled and the latter is four-levelled obscures the schemata used for cartographic symbolisation. This issue becomes more urgent in constructing a rule-base for an expert system accommodated for statistical mapping. A framework for understanding the issue is provided. It reviews some of the obvious inconsistencies and investigates a possible solution, that is a symbolisation schema that might be applied as a cartographic rule base. This suggests a symbolisation schema applied to two main purposes of maps : those used as a visualisation tool and those used as a communication device.

AB  - This paper highlights the evolution of localisation strategies of economic activities in the Belgian urban hierarchy and, by extension, analyses modifications in the economic profile of Belgian urban areas. The shift to post-Fordism and the rise of post-industrial society constantly seeking for flexibility for its economic production system has led to a complete change of structure in economy networks and has induced a readjustment within the models and strategies of economic activity localisation. Consequently, the inherited spatial economic structures had to adapt to these changes. Firstly, this paper focuses on how these changes have affected the urban hierarchy distribution of activities and stresses the specificities of the Belgian city-system associated with these evolutions. Secondly, this paper aims to evaluate the hierarchical processes’ impacts on the systemic evolution of the Belgian urban areas and on their economic profiles. In order to do so, multivariate analysis was chosen upon its robustness and its potential to conciliate sectorial employment data, diachronic study and systemic analysis of the Belgian city-system.

AB  - A majority of elderly suburbanites aspires to age at home. In a car-dependant environment, access to mobility may be a key dimension for the maintenance of such aspirations. However, few researches can confirm the temporal evolution of seniors’ residential aspirations, as well as the transformations of their mobility in the territory. In that regard, a group of an hundred and two aged suburbanites living in the agglomeration of Québec city in Canada were investigated twice in 1999 and 2006. Out of these, seventy are still living at the same address in 2006. Unexpectedly, respondents who have moved are not those for whom a move seemed to be expected in 1999. In 2006, fifty-seven out of an hundred and two, now aged from 61 to 89 years in 2006, responded to a postal questionnaire (62 %). Comparative analysis of elderly suburbanites’ mobility uses have been produced by using descriptive statistics coupled to spatial analysis. For seventeen subjects, their daily mobility remains unchanged, for sixteen suburbanites a decrease is observed, but for fifteen others their mobility has now increased. For the last nine subjects, their mobility has been transformed without being able to statute for a greater or declined mobility. Increasing mobility seems to be explained by socio-spatial factors, especially in regards to the relocation of urban amenities outside the suburban neighborhood. The individual factor stressing the access to automobile, including age and level of autonomy, seems to explain a reduction of mobility.

AB  - The urban sprawl is usually associated with the idea of unsuitable development. It depends on numerous simultaneous processes which make it difficult to deal with. Its modelling appears then an interesting means to understand it and to run simulations, according to different scenarios of urban development, for making planning decisions. The methodological approach presented here combines three steps. Each one corresponds to a model : the first step deals with the quantification of the sprawl (transition model), the second with its location (potential model), and the third one with its differentiation (cellular automata). These three steps are associated to a spatio-temporal database, using a grid to store the needed information within a GIS.

AB  - Today's French legislation and the current town-planning principles put a special emphasis on the notion of territorial project and prospect. It can be based on several simulations and also require modelling. The type of simulation described here includes three complementary stages to successively quantify, localize and differentiate the urban areas' probable future changes. This kind of modelling must also rest on a sturdily thought-out estimate of the relevant parameters. In the case we are talking about, the study of previous situations provides several indicators to define the coefficients that are to be inserted into the models. The example of the town of Belfort is used to illustrate the method of urban modelling and model calibrating as a whole.

We compute eight spatial structure indicators to achieve a classification of the major metropolitan regions (Urban Audit’s "Larger Urban Zones" with over 500,000 inhabitants), using the density grid of the European Environment Agency (2002). This work provides useful insights into the diversity of metropolitan structures in Europe, and sheds new light on the comparison between the actual structure of metropolitan regions and theoretical compact and polycentric spatial structures. Our findings emphasize the need to better account for metropolitan spatial structure through a multidimensional approach in order to formulate sustainable planning models fitted to the local context.

Using a survey, the validity of this decision theory can be partly confirmed, but its implementation underlines a set of difficulties related in particular to the information acquisition.

AB  - The irrigated perimeters of the Office of Niger seem to take a new start as the programs of rehabilitation succeed. Nevertheless, in spite of real progresses, we have to insist on the absence of any regional conception of development in those agricultural programs. Especially, the deficiency of management of the natural resorts while the drought is persisting, leads to environmental degradations. Despite an improvement of water management, wastes are still enormous. Soils suffer diverse form of degradation. The needs of fuel wood are increasing rapidly, so, the supply of irrigated perimeters particularly the five urban centres leads to problems : the nearer resorts of wood are exhausted and prices are growing up. The Office of Niger cattle count some 300 000 animals and its management become difficult. Cultures of rice and vegetable are spreading in the irrigated zone and surroundings while rain cultures are developing in the dry zone, even in the pastoral area. The degradations on the cultures and on the hydraulic network are increasing, leading to conflicts between shepherds and farmers. However, some enterprises seem to be able to stop this evolution and to preserve the resorts. The intensification of breeding is beginning in some sectors of the Office (Niono and N’Débougou), the creation of a transformation unit in Niono is inciting the production of milk. Nevertheless, these progresses stand embryonic and divided. So, it is necessary to widen the reflection to the whole region, and to considerate the complicated relations which exist between the dry regions and the irrigated perimeters and the plural functions of resorts and lands. While new adjustments will be undertaken soon, it should be urgent to envisage an assessment of the errors which have been made, to be able to reflect about how to protect the ecological an the development of the rural societies in this region. A Regional Schema of Development is elaborating with lots of difficulties. Negotiations have provisionally stopped because of discords between the Malian state, the Office of Niger and the AFD (French Agency of Development).

It also underlines how spatial is her analysis of the main political and anthropological questions she has addressed in her most famous books. It concludes that the diversity of the spatial proposals in Arendt’s work is organized with three spatialities or conceptions of space: The spatiality of places, the spatiality of positions, and the spatiality of action. These spatialities do not refer to three independant modes of existence of space; they are articulated in her analysis of human condition and of “common worlds” and subsumed to two others concepts, even much more central, in her work: identity and plurality.

AB  - Thinking about what Europe is, about its location or its limits often consists in trying to identify something such as a European identity, a common project or adherence to a lifestyle. In this perspective, the feeling of belonging to a place implies various dimensions, including subjective perceptions. To explore this, the research project EuroBroadMap and the survey “Visions of Europe”, conducted on a sample of 10,000 students living in eighteen different countries around the world, allows us to enrich our comprehension of these perceptions of Europe. From a set of words spontaneously related to Europe by the students surveyed, the methods of textual statistics enabled us to measure the variety of the vocabulary associated to this place. Several factors may explain the diversity of the words obtained : the students’ academic fields and countries of residence strongly condition the way they perceive Europe. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that belonging to the European Union or to its margins influences the individual perceptions.

AB  - Since the Rio Summit, the sustainable development has become a part of the international law. The International participation in the subsidized projects related to sustainable development has further strengthened its importance. In the third world countries and Algeria is one of them, “the appropriation” of sustainable development seems to move slowly and in a way that seems so far unclear and ambiguous. We focus on this to shed light on the appropriability of actors at the local level, where the policy makes sense. At first glance, it seems that there is an asymmetric appropriation between policies posted and what is happening locally. Local actors do not seem to be willing to accommodate locally the sustainable development. This article aims to open a debate about this gap between policy as willingness and practice as action locally built.

AB  - The extreme diversity of the mountainous zones of northern Vietnam causes national policies to have vastly different outcomes in different areas, even within the same province or district. In this paper, we examine the relationships between the biophysical and socioeconomic factors that shape peoples’ livelihood strategies and, ultimately, their standards of living. We combine a regional-level geographic approach with localized monographic studies to assess the effect of geographic conditions on rural development. After identifying the village as the elementary unit of natural resource management, we demonstrate that landscape composition is an important defining factor behind village production systems. Villages that have production systems based on wide valley bottoms cropped with irrigated rice tend to be compact and accessible. In contrast, villages in steeply-sloped forested areas tend to be spread out, inaccessible. The Doi moi reforms of the 1980s and 1990s have mostly benefited the former type of villages, populated mostly by the Tày and Kinh ethnic groups, while leaving behindthe latter type, mostly Dao and H’mong. The geographic approach offers researchers a mechanism for identifying the villages in greatest need of technical assistance.

Built-up areas have markedly increased during the last decades, especially on the Petite Côte region, which is becoming the first region of the country regarding tourism and leisure activities. SPOT images from 1988 and 2000 are processed here in order to characterise the distribution pattern and the spatial dynamics of built-up areas. A method for the extraction of built-up areas through a semi-automatic way, by means of spectral and spatial satellite image processing is presented. Quantification of built-up dynamics is finally provided by granulometric analysis on the pre-processed satellite images.

AB  - Environmental scientists often face situations where: (i) stimulus-response relationships are non-linear; (ii) data are rare or imprecise; (iii) facts are uncertain and stimulus-responses relationships are questionable. In this paper, we focus on the first two points. A powerful and easy-to-use statistical method, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, allows the quantification of the uncertainty attached to any model response. This stochastic simulation technique is able to reproduce the statistical joint distribution of the whole parameter set of any model. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is described and illustrated on a typical environmental model: the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). The aim is to provide a helpful guideline for further, and ultimately more complex, models. As a first illustration, the MH-method is also applied to a simple regression example to demonstrate to the practitioner the ability of the algorithm to produce valid results.

AB  - This article highlights the interplay of scales in the work of a researcher mapping out a research itinerary. The question at hand is that of the choice of a particular scale of observation, or  series of nested scales. Two types of areas were studied in the tropical countryside, in Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) and Madagascar. The first area type are those constructed by the actors (context of research), highlighting the native land. The second area type are those constructed by the actors (context of action), through a policy of decentralization focusing on the new rural commune. In both cases, cartographical representation plays an important role. Maps are able to analyze, they produce information within the spatial context of the actors, they are an instrument of thinking, and they support a dialogue between researchers and developers. Since the 1990s, policies addressing the management of natural resources while recognizing the role of local populations ponder the correct choice of spatial scale: the local scale (native land) or the supralocal scale (the rural commune).

AB  - This paper focuses on the process of metropolization in Russia, through an illustration: the border city of Rostov-on-Don. Our purpose is to determine if the city participates in the current metropolization process, and with which system it interacts most intensely (European, national or regional system of cities). Considering the border situation of Rostov-on-Don leads to an evaluation of pluses and minuses that this border represents regarding the perspectives of integration in the European system of cities.

AB  - In order to get a better understanding of the complex patterns in undergoing urban changes, this paper aims at studying property values, with an emphasis on methodological experimentation. Property values not only describe intrinsic characteristics of housing (hedonic pricing) but also the characteristics of place, assessed and perceived at different geographical levels (location in a city, social characteristics of the neighborhood, and these of the street). Prices changes also induce a powerful social filter in city core areas. In an experimental perspective at the lower local scale, this paper elaborates on an analysis of property values of housing in downtown Paris (1990-2003). In a context of dropping prices followed by a time of continuous and unparalleled growth of prices since 1997, we analyze the complexity of spatial shifts and adjustments of prices, so that we might identify underlying depreciation and valuation dynamics at a infra-neighborhood level. A first section reviews different time-patterns of prices change over the decade, with a special focus on resulting spatial patterns.  We then discuss the dynamics of spatial dissimilarities in price patterns, such as fading, reinforcing and moving boundaries of prices. By the means of confronting methodological approaches (smoothing, discontinuity analysis), we give insights on the most significant spatial patterns of change in a time-series of housing prices.  We promote this exploratory approach as an effort towards a better understanding of the complexity of spatial contexts in the formation of prices, as contexts and neighborhood effects are often roughly incorporated in price modeling as an externality in the valuation (i.e. hedonic pricing). In a general trend of price towards a greater homogeneity, contrasts and dissimilarities between neighborhoods move according to local planning policies and change in the image of a neighborhood. We observe on one hand a reinforcement of the core-periphery gradient and a continuous valorization of the city core, and on the other hand the increase of prices in the peripheries creates a greater heterogeneity and composites and contrasted local patterns.

AB  - Since the geographical information system revolution of the mid-1980s, there has been a rapid growth in the number of spatially referenced databases. Data management, within these new systems, immediately took up a large place, but today, as argued Stan Openshaw, "analysis is no longer an optional activity". Nevertheless, we may keep in mind that spatial data have very special properties, that create a need for spatial data analysis and spatial. Furthermore, it may be argued that, in a GIS context, user's needs are mainly of a data exploratory nature. Yet, data-driven tools can be hardly found within classical GIS software, when they may be available at all.

AB  - For more than 30 years we have been periodically observing  multiannual outbreaks of grassland rodents, Arvicola terrestris Sherman, in Auvergne (France). This phenomenon is more and more frequent and heavy despite of chemical treatment. That’s why we study the relationships between water vole and their predators within landscape and farming practices. In order to test different situations of landscape organisations, we develop a simulator which will enable to quantify the evolution of predator and vole populations. This simulator uses a spatial model based on cellular automata. Instead of classical approach of population dynamics, we have chosen cellular automata. This technique enables to perform spatial simulations. Simple rules apply on wide number of elements. These local and individual interactions determine complex behaviour of the system at the global level. Nowaday computer speed enables this kind of approach. Maps of land use, maps of vole densities and number of various predators are the input variables of model. Several parameters enable to tune constitutive rules of our model (movement and reproduction of voles, hunt territory and predation, evolution of predator density, …). Outputs : for each iteration the simulator creates maps of vole densities and calculates the number of each species. One iteration represent one year. The first results which are obtained on a real territory (municipalities of Ceyssat and Olby in the department of Puy-de-Dôme) are encouraging. We hope that our simulator (when it will be tuned and validated) will enable to carry out a wide number of “virtual” experiments that are unfeasible in “real” world.

AB  - There is an internationally shared agreement on the use of indicators for evaluating the sustainability of the observed patterns of urban development. The most commonly used framework to organise and select such indicators is the Pressures-State-Responses scheme. First proposed by the OECD to organise environmental indicators, its inadequacy is increasingly evident. The weaknesses of the conceptual frameworks currently used in urban sustainability analysis induced us to develop a more coherent theoretical framework in the form of a systemic scheme. The new scheme combines the causal approach of the Pressures-State-Responses model and the focus on urban sustainability issues of the extended urban metabolism model by Newman and Kenworthy. In this paper, the new scheme was used to derive a systemic framework for the assessment of the sustainability of urban mobility. First, we adapted the general scheme to the analysis of urban mobility. Successively, using the cognitive mapping software Decision Explorer, we further developed this scheme to obtain a more disaggregated conceptual model. A selection table could be derived for every element of the model to guide the selection of pertinent indicators based on the systemic links of the element. We could thus define a set of some sixty system indicators to be used in the assessment of the sustainability of urban mobility. The selected set of indicators reflects the causal links between phenomena and can monitor the attainment of sustainability objectives for the urban mobility system. All indicators allow geographical comparison and integrate the role played by different urban actors and modes of transportation. This work has been carried out within the first year of a joint PhD research program at the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis and at the Polytechnic of Milan.

AB  - It is well known that the social perception of coastal zone has partly changed under the influence of painting since the XVIIIth and XIXth centuries. However, this influence may only have concerned beaches, cliffs and ports, but in no way coastal wetlands. For medical, economical, social, technical and æsthetical reasons, this specific environment remained ignored by French painters till the beginning of the XXth century – what could partly be an explanation for its long-standing repulsive image in the French society. Nevertheless, picture and status of wetlands have recently evolved, as well as the social perception and the social context regarding them – last proof of a mutual but changing influence between pictorial representations, social perception and social context. The analysis of French painters’ actual works will illustrate this reversal and offer a dialogue between painting and geography.

AB  - In an 1881 letter to his colleague Paul Pelet, the geographer Élisée Reclus explains that, during the redaction of the 7th volume of his Nouvelle Géographie universelle consecrated to Oriental Asia, he tries first to understand the viewpoint of the cultures he deals with: “I become Chinese”, he writes. In this task he is assisted by two cultural transferors, rather influent at that time in the field of the “oriental” studies, like the Russian geographer and anarchist Léon Metchnikoff and the Geneva sinologist François Turrettini. First, we analyse this original scientific network, and then we deal with the Reclus’ texts on China, to rethink the construction of this country as a geographic object, in the works of the first European scientists who tried to apprehend Extra-European peoples on a plan of parity. They deal with cultural differences according to a method, which we can call today ‘empathic’, without stating a preconceived European superiority. Moreover, these geographers are already very attentive to the economic and demographic dynamics of China, foreseeing for the following decades the reshaping of Europe and the ‘geopolitical’ rising of the Pacific’s scenario. As Reclus writes in 1885 in a letter to Peter Kropotkin, the peoples that the ethnographers called at that time ‘non-Arians’, including Chinese people, “are not negligible quantities”.

AB  - Over the last few years, the phenomenon of the franchise as a new way of doing business has been undergoing a notable increase in Spain, with year on year growth rates of around 40%. As a result, Spain’s retail trade is suffering considerable transformations and growing ever closer to a similar profile to that dominant in other countries of the EU. This phenomenon of franchises in Spain, however, goes far beyond a mere modification of business manners, as it can only be correctly understood if it is placed in a framework of other processes with much wider dimensions linking the economies, and even the societies, of the developed world: economic globalisation, management innovations, the creation of network organisations or the progress towards standardisation, among others. Behind this conceptual structure, the authors attempt to demonstrate how the franchise networks are being implemented in Spain, what their main features are and what behaviour they follow as regards distribution of franchises throughout the territory and within the major cities of Spain. Finally, after pointing out the potential impacts of the franchise system on Spain’s business fabric, some research lines are indicated for further analysis.

AB  - Since the first edition of De Martonne’s Traité in France, geomorphology and geography fell from coexistence to domination then marginalization of the former. However, the changes of geography on one hand, the conditions of existence, content and practices of geomorphology today on the other hand imply that the many different specialties of this field of science question both the definition of geography and geology. In fact, though the multiple causes, effects and consequences of erosion may be more or less claimed by any specialist, either of geodynamics, engineering, agronomy, land use planning or sociology, a retrospective analysis shows that the geographers have long develop further reflection on all these matters. But the situation has changed significantly during the 1990s, including the recovery of part of the geomorphological questioning by a growing number of specialists from the geosciences, and the development of the geography of risk. Therefore, to address “the” geomorphology without any further specification is equivalent to reify a growing scientific field whose characteristics are its diversity and interdisciplinary nature. In fact, considering their complexity as a whole, landform studies are both a dynamic component of geology on the side of Earth sciences, as well as geography on the side of Social sciences.

The site holds various activities that are producing sometimes clashes of interest. Besides, located at the core of the metropolis, the area is subject to a great urban pressure resulting in environmental deterioration Over the past decade, local managers are realizing the importance of environmental protection. But multifunctional space management is confronted to numerous issues: is a strict environmental preservation relevant for an area developed for centuries? Is it possible to reconcile tourism development with preservation in an already fragile environment? How to operate on private plots? The management of multifunctional space is a complex exercise. It must be done in close dialogue between all stakeholders and apply both locally closest to those issues and generally to take the regional context into account.

AB  - It is common practice nowadays to use the Burgess graphic model to explain intra-urban city's structures. It was built up in the twenties and french geographers came to know about it before the thirties. Its diffusion among the scientific community is due to papers from the french sociologist Maurice Halbwachs and the american geographers Harris and Ullman. We are drawing here a sample of the ways this model was received in french geography. Our intentions remain modest : to throw light on an interessing and unknown research material, to draw up a research question. We analyse the welcoming of the Burgess model as a product of a confrontation between two analysis grids of urban space, both associated with two different epistemological corpus : french geographers have translated, according to their conceptual background, the researchs of this american sociologist, which remained peculiar to them in many ways. Studying the graphic transformations in the concentric model allows to underline this process of intellectual embezzlement.

The first process corresponds to the developments of the arguments of a Deputy who at the beginning of is career relies on the local territory that elected him but who then progressively turns to the national scale. The second process concerns the discussion about the reform of the postal tariff that goes gradually from the reference to the territory and its roughness to an approach through social relations. The whole is to be seen within the framework of the years that precedes the start of the Second Republic bringing the Universal Suffrage, the unique Postal Tariff and the support of this Deputy for the Republican ideal.

AB  - The need to define synthetic indices useful for comparing the socio-economic profiles of areas is a major topic of interest in many fields of urban and regional analysis. Related to it is the need to address the problem of the spatial variability of phenomena. In this respect, the notions of heterogeneity, dispersion, disequilibrium and the complementary notions of homogeneity, concentration and equilibrium are particularly relevant. In many practical cases, however, the use of these notions can generate confusion and difficulties of communication because of their definitions. This papers aims to show that the several definitions which can be found in the literature refer to a same underlying concept and their differences are mainly due to the nature of data and measurement approaches. The paper is articulated into two parts. Part 1 discusses some main definitions of the above notions and illustrates the statistical indices associated with them. Part 2 presents an application of the proposed indices to the spatial distribution of jobs, by economic sector, in Piedmont.

Each one received one disposable camera and a list of questions about his landscape that he had to illustrate with his own pictures. An individual discussion was conducted in a second time to define with each one, personnal and cultural aspects of his landscapes, what he considered as beautiful or bad elements in these landscapes and what he imagined for the future. As this first test was succesfull, we consider that this kind of landscape analysis could be useful to prepare a development programm in rural areas. Even if this method has to be better, it can soon be used by non specialist technicians to analyse the influence of landscape representations upon local planning management decisions.

The operating processes within the peri-urban and rural neighbouring zones, together with the small and average-sized towns in the neighbourhood, 30-40 km end 60-70 km from the capital, have created a large integrated zone of metropolitan solidarity in the North-East areas : those of farming intensification and dairy basins, employment basins as well as two metropolitan bases of operations : One is the industrial harbor (Bizerte and Menzel Bourguiba), the other is a tourist one (Nabeul and Hammamet). The latter are related to new demographic tendencies, to the land market pressure, mainly, to the conversion of the productive system under the increasing effect of globalization, those processes infer the “emerging metropolity” of Tunis and explain the territory recomposition of the North-East of Tunisia. However, tourism and industry are no longer the only vectors of this opening up and of this metropolity. The new choices and projects on the sport-congress-culture and logistic and transport activities will contribute to strengthen the Tunis metropolitan zone of solidarity and to extend it to the South through a metropolitan trunk road assuming the junction of the North-East to the Sahel of Sousse. These two sets will shape a triangle representing the most competitive space of the country around a central metropolitan zone modernized, rehabilitated and more open. This triangle will be reinforced towards the South by evident master positions. That foresees, then, a deep reorganization of the Tunisian space in witch this competitive triangle, undergoing massive changes today, would take more and more land.

AB  - This article continues the exploration of the antagonistic ternary logic of S. Lupasco in the geographic field. It examines its contribution to the issue of systems of cities, relying on the works of A. Bretagnolle and D. Pumain [2010] which consider these systems as "a progressive construction founded on a variety of spatialized interactions between heterogeneous entities in co-evolution". This affirmation is in agreement with the ternary logico-geographical theorizing proposed by H. Reymond [2009, 2011] and provides the opportunity to reflect on the concept of co-evolution, a reflection in three parts. The first part studies the role of a logico-mathematical coupling in the dynamics of co-evolution, using the Lotka-Volterra model and the idea of permanent "society-biosphere" coupling expressed by A. Berque’s mediance concept. The second part underlines that the logico-mathematical consistency that ensues allows its generalization to a geocartographic reasoning anchored in antagonistic ternary formalization. In the third part, this reasoning allowed us to test the transdisciplinary transfer of nomadic concepts coupling biology and geography: the growth in size of animals and that of systems of cities both present energy consumptions raised to the same 0.75 power. The conclusion puts forward the idea of a coupled "energy-density" deployment: the medial action of human societies in the construction of systems of cities follows dynamics coupling idiosyncratic local morphologic solutions to the nomothetic limits which require that the "energy-density" ratio be organized in a framework permitting the necessary flow circulation. The resulting couplings do not seem to contradict the tested hypothesis: they developed along a negative allometry varying around the 0.75 power. Finally, this value, which still needs to be validated, seems to correspond to sociobiological constraints whereas increasing allometrics appear to reflect the socioeconomic adjustments of the urban spread of human populations around the globe.

AB  - The study analyzes the consequences of a settlement in the urban fringe on the mobility practices, starting from an investigation near households recently settled close to Rennes (Ille-et-Vilaine, France). This investigation confirms the strong mobility of this type of households and the car modal preponderance, whose the causes are : less journey time, information and organization costs bound to the use of public transport to which is associated by the middle class a social statute loss. The assumption of a low anticipation of the new mobility constraints induced by the residential choice is confirmed. The households recognize their automobile dependence, without we observe a mobility rationalization except some circuits of multi-objects trips or some car-sharing behaviour for the leisures. To reduce car traffic, it thus appears more effective to act upstream by a land and real estate policy supporting a more compact town planning.

AB  - The urban dynamics during the XXe century makes it possible to understand the problems created by urban expansion (polluting industry on the littoral, clogging of the road traffic in the downtown area…) in Sfax agglomeration. The urban heat island was detected using NOAA-AVHRR data and in parallel, air temperature and sea breeze velocity and direction was observed in some points in the city. All these observations show that the downtown area is considerably hotter than the suburbs (variation around 5°C) and sea breeze is strongly slowed down there because of the roughness of the city. These two factors create discomfort conditions for the population. Monoxide carbon (CO) rate measurements, used here like tracer of pollution, were also carried out on several points in the agglomeration. It shows the major role of the urban traffic or, during some weather conditions, the establishments located in south Industrial Area (Chemical industiy, waste incineration). The spatial extension of sulfur dioxide (SO2), obtained by digital model, by using weather parameters, shows the strong influence of the sea breeze on the space concentration and distribution of this polluting.

AB  - It is usually accepted that the French word “mondialisation” was coined in the early 1960s and that its use became common since the 1980s, although we also recognize that globalization, as a progressive integration of different parts of the world, began before. Today, the increasing digitization of publications allows us to refine the researches on past use of words and their invention. Thus it appears that the French word “mondialisation” undoubtedly goes back to the period of the First World War and since then it has been regularly used, but without finding the success it has experienced since the 1990s. The historical study of the lexical field of globalization in different European languages, put towards the process of globalization since the end of the XVth century, allows following the various stages of the elaboration of a speech on the unification of the world until today.

This parallels the extreme poverty of cartographic representation of Québec. However, the recent publishing of a new map, designed within political circles, happens to find a warm welcome among the public ; this new map depicts a territorial image of Québec that is very different from the previous ones. It illustrates the geopolitical dimension of map-making, as the establishes a direct link between the graphic image of a territory and the debate surrounding the definition of the national territory.

Second, we discuss some elementary principles of cartography in order to show the importance of the nature of z in thematic mapping.

AB  - Location analysis has become ‘intrinsically linked with GIS-based analysis and modelling.’ Optimal location models are often used for decision making to locate facilities to maximise access to clients/demand within a defined continuous area of possibilities. But what happens if the potential location of demand is spatially confined and best location model is applied to choose between different stationary facility sites? This is a question concerning the mining industry in the UK, who wants to restore exhausted quarries (facilities) into energy-crop fields. A small number of quarries have to be selected within a larger panel of potential quarries sites to be restored. These selected quarries have vocation to supply a power station with energy-crop. We defined the quarries of best location to be converted into energy crops supplier sites by minimising the transport costs (required criteria) of crops to a power station. We derived transport cost from distance measurements and time of travel. Therefore, the objective function of the model minimized the demand distance/time of travel (expressing transport cost) between the demand node (Power station) and the nearest quarry(ies). Based on the shortest path distance criteria, the demand of crops required for the power station was allocated to the quarries until the demand was satisfied. Doing so, the cluster of quarries of best location (minimum distance/time) to be restored in energy-crop fields was identified in order to minimize the transport cost. Several ways to assess the time of travel between quarries and power site were explored and tested in the model of quarries selection. Much attention was given to measuring accessibility. First, based on metric distance the length of roads was used to find the least cost path. Multi-criteria distance-time measures were computed according to the length of the road, the travel speed according to the type of road, the gradient slope of the road derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) values and the ‘slow down effect’ of urban areas. The results of the different routing processes were compared. Our findings underline the use of multi-criteria travel time calculations in order to improve accuracy of accessibility and location models. The method was tested on a sample area in the North of England and could be extended and applied to the entire UK with some accommodations. This is presented as part of the methodology and discussed in the conclusion.

AB  - The process of European Union enlarging is going on, involving in 2004 ten Central or Oriental European Countries (PECO), and later some Mediterranean countries (PTM). But EU still asks important questions : what are the candidate countries which will be first included ? What will induce this process on European relationship ? How high is the risk that some other countries may be evicted (in terms of trade) due to other countries integration ? This paper aims to understand more precisely the global potential trade evolution between actual and future EU included oriental or Mediterranean countries. We try to enhance economical factors and geographical constraints which explain trade levels between (groups of) countries. We first model the trade flows for each aggregate of countries. Then, we simulate and assess the impact of including other (blocs of) countries to the UE model and both EU and PTM aggregates. Our study uses a classical gravity modelling (designed by Bergstrand and Festoc) and compute some data (got from the Chelem database) mainly from 1993 to 1997. We add in our model the foreign invests in each country, the contiguity level between countries and the distance separating countries centres. Our approach includes flows modelling, simulations of integration processes and a comparison of  relative economical elasticities between the different models.

AB  - The climate variability was generally studied in West Africa and particularly in Ivory Coast. The rainfall variability was especially analysed. Therefore, rainfall variables such as rainy days frequencies and rainfall seasonal duration are little studied. The main purpose of the following work is to show the climate influence on seasonal rainfall regimes on the N’zi (Bandama) watershed. We have documented two main aspects of climate variability. In the first part, the climate variability was characterised by the analysis of air temperature, air humidity, rainfall index, rainfall frequencies days and seasonal rainfall duration. In the second step, we have compared the standard monthly rainfall for 1951-2000 period so as to analyse the behaviour of seasonal rainfall regimes in the climate variability context. An analysis in normalized principal components (ANPC) allowed the analysis of the impact of the climatic factors on the seasonal rainfall regimes. The climate variability was manifested by a decline of the spatial and temporal annual rainfall, a decrease of rainfall frequencies days particularly those which are superiors to 10 mm and a reduction of rainfall seasonal duration (30 to 35 days) since 1970. In this study, the most important result of our investigations is the lack of change in the monthly rainfall regimes on the N’zi (Bandama) watershed. The analysis in normalized principal components (ANPC) based on fourteen (14) variables, made it possible to highlight the impact of climate variability on the seasonal rainfall regimes. The first principal component (F1) is associated with the factors defining the atmospheric conditions. The principal second and the third components (F2 and F3) are associated with the variables related to precipitations. As for the factors which influence the temporal variability of the seasonal pluviometric regimes, it appeared that the six rainfall variables are influenced by air temperature as well as the relative humidity of the air. It is thus concluded that air temperature and the relative humidity of the air are factors of the temporal variability of the seasonal rainfall regimes on the N’zi (Bandama) watershed.

Now trade is expanding, and investment from China in the border area is stimulating growth along the Amur River. But with growth also come water withdrawals: sortages have already appeared in the basin. Prospects are all the more problematic as northern China is facing severe water shortages that could partly be solved, in the medium term, by a derivation from the Amur/Heilongjiang Basin.

AB  - This paper analyzes city-port relationships on a world scale through the three concepts of centrality, nodality and intermediacy. 330 port cities represent half of the world’s coastal urban population and container traffic volumes. A factor analysis highlights the maritime or urban specializations of the nodes. Results show that beyond a north-south hierarchical structure, profiles are distributed across relatively homogenous regional areas. The typology illustrates the disequilibria of city-port relations in major European port cities, while other regions show a higher city-port interdependence. This world differentiation allows questioning a unique model of city-port relationships and, at the same time, provides a better understanding of the spatial and functional principles defining the port city in general.

AB  - Begun with a series of statement reports in the sixties, studies of urban sprawl today focus more on an understanding of the phenomenon and explanations of it (in particular, in its relation to transport).  Much of the research analyzes urban sprawl from the angle of road speeds.  Because they often use very general combined international scales based on sketchy statistics, these studies do not manage to treat the question on a smaller scale—for example, on issues related to communal land—primarily because of lack of data on speed. The object of this article is to provide a methodology that will make it possible to obtain data speeds that are suitable for use in more general studies on urban sprawl.  The piece offers a series of procedures aiming at gradually integrating a wide variety of parameters:  the curve of the roads, statistics on the number of roadways, the percentage of heavy lorries, the volume of traffic and, finally, the number of traffic lights.  The latter are integrated in a hybrid model associating logistic graphs, a macroscopic traffic model (Greenshields) and a stochastic (random variation) model for calculating waiting times at traffic lights.

AB  - French academic geography during the major part of the 20th century is especially renowned for its regional monographs, written as doctoral theses. Foreign geographers think, first and foremost, of those monographs about regions of France, however a large amount of doctoral work covered non-metropolitan regions. Using professorial patronage as a lens, this article focuses on the production and reception of one hundred theses completed between 1893 and 1969. Dubois and Vidal de La Blache supported the first cohort, to be followed by an interwar generation under the patronage of professors at the Sorbonne and to a much lesser extent in the provinces. After 1945, the production of doctoral theses greatly increased, with patrons in Paris being complemented by provincial counterparts, especially in Bordeaux. Only three of the hundred candidates considered here were women. Academic advancement for most geographers with non-metropolitan experience meant returning to a university post in France, however many retained a passionate attachment to their fieldwork region.

AB  - This research is the logical continuation of several previous studies concerning the relations mutually connecting the configuration of the urban grid, the movement of activities in the urban settlement, and the location of these activities. Those studies were aimed at verifying the reliability of the hypothesis on which configurational analysisis based (Hillier, Hanson, 1984, Hillier, 1996a) : the role of the urban grid (appraised in configurational terms, that is to say, with regard only to the spatial relations mutually connecting all its paths) as the primary element both in the production of movement and in the location of activities. Such an assumption, if proved, should allow the prediction of the distribution of pedestrian flows and the location of urban activities on the mere basis of the configuration of the grid, making it possible to set aside the issue of the presence and position of the located activities. In the research that has been conducted so far (Cutini, 1999a ; Cutini, 1999b), we have actually proved the existence of a significant correlation between configuration and pedestrian movement, while at the same specifying its limits : the correlation, very clear within limited sub-systems of the overall grid, becomes dramatically weaker if extended over the whole grid. In this study, we have taken land use into consideration, extending the analysis to the correlation between the presence of the located activities and the distribution of configurational indexes. The research has focused on the two case studies that had been previously selected and analysed ; the test on a third urban case, which was chosen as a particularly significant example, provides further confirmation of the results to date. These results make it possible to prove that the methods of configurational analysis (Hillier, 1996a) provide a reliable predictive tool for determining the capacity of each part of the urban settlement to create activities and enable them to flourish ; at the same time, we have also been able to pinpoint the range of reliability of these methods. In other words, the results obtained provide a new definition of the notion of urban centrality, appraised in terms of attractiveness, setting aside the actual presence and position of the located activities. Furthermore, on the basis of these results, the location of monopolistic activities emerges as a strategic variable in town planning and management.

AB  - Multitemporal Landsat7-ETM+ imagery and supplementary field survey data were used to establish a crop and land use map for an area of ±20 000 km² of Sanjiang Plain in China’s north-eastern province Heilongjiang. The “field-based” map is based on data of the year 2002 and is created by combining the results of a supervised Maximum Likelihood classification with the estimated field boundaries extracted by an automatic segmentation procedure. No sufficient ground truth was available to perform an independent validation, and some classes are certainly confused. Nevertheless, given the minimal investments and the unexplored potentials for improvement, the approach seems very promising and cost-effective. By superimposing the classification with the map of the administrative counties, regional statistics were derived with the acreage distributions of the concerned crops and land use types.

AB  - Coastal flooding in the Gulf of Lions is associated with storm-surges linked with southeasterly winds that push up the water toward the coasts. At a synoptic scale, these meteorological conditions are associated with a deep barometric depression near the Bay of Biscay. This is favored by the negative phase of the North-Atlantic Oscillation that leads to a southward shift of the main stormtrack over the northern Atlantic. In the second half of the 20th century, the frequency of southeasterlies shows a significant increase in the whole Gulf of Lions, paradoxically with the positive deviation of the North-Atlantic Oscillation. Changes in the mean atmospheric conditions at this broad spatial-scale have increased the probability of barometric depression near the Bay of Biscay and of southeasterlies in the Gulf of Lions during negative phase of the North-Atlantic Oscillation.

Some topics were the subject of a thorough reflexion (definition of the concept of “urban” for example) but others still need to be improved (approach of the informal economic sector). However, it provides new data, such as the transportation means used by the commuters.

In other words, here and there, past and present are the criteria that enable to read the narrated experience of the explorers fully. How do they give shape to Litang, a Tibetan town on the road from Beijing to Lhasa they are the first to visit? What kind of relationship with the place of the other do they develop? To what interaction does their encounter lead? The way they describe a place that had never been seen before them suggests reflections on the introduction of a foreign place into Western geographical consciousness and on the multiple patterns of our toposensibility.

The ascension to power of a coalition led by the BJP (Bharatya Janata Party) is the result of this party’s policy to nominate for the first time candidates from intermediate castes in certain states and from regional parties in others that were traditional allies of the Congress Party, long run by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The major challenges facing this government are improving governance, with the establishment of clear relationships between the Centre and the States, and keeping a safe distance from aggressive forms of hindutva.

AB  - For the first time the systems of cities in seven countries or regions among the largest in the world (China, India, Brazil, Europe, the Former Soviet Union (FSU), the United States and South Africa) are made comparable through the building of spatio-temporal standardised statistical databases. We first explain the concept of a generic evolutionary urban unit (“city”) and its necessary adaptations to the information provided by each national statistical system. Second, the hierarchical structure and the urban growth process are compared at macro-scale for the seven countries with reference to Zipf’s and Gibrat’s model: in agreement with an evolutionary theory of urban systems, large similarities shape the hierarchical structure and growth processes in BRICS countries as well as in Europe and United States, despite their positions at different stages in the urban transition that explain some structural peculiarities. Third, the individual trajectories of some 10,000 cities are mapped at micro-scale following a cluster analysis of their evolution over the last fifty years. A few common principles extracted from the evolutionary theory of urban systems can explain the diversity of these trajectories, including a specific pattern in their geographical repartition in the Chinese case. We conclude that the observations at macro-level when summarized as stylised facts can help in designing simulation models of urban systems whereas the urban trajectories identified at micro-level are consistent enough for constituting the basis of plausible future population projections.

AB  - Energy consumption in the buildings is responsible for more than 40% of France greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the “thermal rehabilitation” of housing buildings, i.e. works to improve their energetic performance, appears as a great challenge for sustainable urban development. However, it faces the difficulty of conciliating heritage protection and the adaptation of old buildings. Through the Paris case study, this article explores how energy issues shed a new light on the debate on heritage and sustainable development. After a quick presentation of the specificity of old buildings with regard to energy consumption, this text examines the context of the thermal rehabilitation of the Parisian heritage, the policies put into action by the Municipality of Paris, and their limits. Although the debate is still largely dominated by the question of the visual impact on the urban landscape of thermal rehabilitation solutions, the absence of a clearly defined discourse makes it difficult to achieve the particularly ambitious objectives set by the Municipality of the French capital.

AB  - This paper employs a cross-cultural analysis to explore regional and national variations in residential gating and enclosure as a first step in developing an integrated theory of urban fragmentation. Utilizing data from the urban and suburban United States, Latin America and China, a series of dimensions are compared: 1) domestic architecture, 2) urban/suburban settlement pattern, 3) the role of the state, 4) governance, 5) citizenship, 6) cultural meaning, 7) identity, 8) provision of goods and services, 9) taxation, 10) degree of privatization, 11) cultural pattern of social sanction, and 12) fear of crime and others. This comparative analysis locates culturally meaningful and theoretically significant distinctions among the regions and provides data for the development of explanatory models in which each region varies along a dimensional continuum.  At the macro-level of analysis, the impact of globalization and flexible accumulation with increased local heterogeneity, increases in inequality and changes in perceived crime rate emerge as the major underlying factors in the fear of crime and others found in all three regions.  At a micro-level, differences in cultural meanings are explained by local social and political contexts, while provision of goods and services and governance depend on club realm economic explanations.

AB  - This study investigated race-and-place profiling in Toronto within a neighbourhood context. It explored the spatial association between race-specific drug-related stops and neighbourhood racial and socio-economic characteristics. The findings of this study suggest that Blacks are subject to disproportionately more stops for drug-related reasons in neighbourhoods where more Whites reside and are less socio-economically disadvantaged, therefore confirming race-and-place profiling of Blacks in Toronto. However, race concentration and socio-economic disadvantage arguments fail to explain the spatial variations in drug-related stops of Whites. This result could be caused by the diverse ethnic origins and socio-economic backgrounds of White Torontonians. This article argues for the importance of a contextualized examination of racial profiling within the spatial context of neighbourhoods and calls for democratic policing in Toronto. It also discusses the negative impacts of race-and-place profiling on Blacks in Toronto.

AB  - Since the mid 19th-century, the vulnerability of the economic stakes on this coastal fringe has been managed mainly by controlling the hazards; this control is coordinated by the national government, which has initiated coastal defense practices. At the beginning of the 1980s, natural risk prevention policies favored managing the consequences of natural disasters, with the creation of the CatNat insurance regime to indemnify natural disaster victims. By the middle of the 1990s, new natural risk management strategies had been invented to complete the control of natural hazards. As part of the emerging philosophy of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM), the French government encouraged the development of natural risk prevention policies by establishing Natural Risk Prevention Plans (PPRn) in 1995. These PPRn were a new approach to shoreline management that favored controlling development in coastal communities. At the beginning of the 21st century, the French government set down the general orientations for managing natural coastal risks, but it was not the only stakeholder involved. Collective action emerged, bringing the national government, public institutions, territorial and local authorities together to develop risk management policies. This collective action was facilitated by a form of decentralization of natural coastal risk management, involving regional or local implementation of the strategic orientations of shoreline management, respecting the general principles defined by the national government. These changes are part of the ICZM implementation process, which has been under way since 2005.

Concerning the prime main objective of the Towntology project, i.e. to build an ontology for urban planning by integrating all urban objects with their descriptions and relations, we began to deal with some fields, such as street planning and mobility. We also developed a software tool making it possible to urban planners to work on a semantic network. Thus we built a visual browser and an ontology editor. An extension of XML is designed and used for the description of the ontology.

AB  - The OSIRIS-Inondation tool was developed in the European Commission’s OSIRIS FP5-IST project. It is now used by several dozen localities in France to generate their Local Emergency Plan and apply action plans during training exercises or real flooding incidents (crisis planning/management). A multi-hazard version of the system has now been developed for helping the mayor and his/her technical services to elaborate, analyze and compare damage and crisis scenarios for natural or technological hazards. OSIRIS helps these stakeholders to evaluate and forecast the exact impact of an imagined or real catastrophe on their locality and is interfaced with external information sources (forecasts) and wider-scale decision-making centres (Prefectures, military zones, etc.). The platform (designed by and for field-based stakeholders) is based on an object-oriented data model and web technologies, enabling it to (i) evolve as a function of the feedback received and (ii) adapt itself to a local authority’s needs and constraints. In addition to the direct threat to local facilities during a crisis and the non-structural measures to be taken in an emergency, ongoing research work is seeking to better take account of induced risks (network crashes and evacuations) and scenarios which focus on mitigating structural vulnerability. In parallel with the immediate provision of decision support services (crisis preparation and management), OSIRIS helps build a hazard knowledge base by capitalizing on all the available digital information (regulation, action files, photo libraries, etc.) over the long term.

AB  - The “dehesas” constitute an example of land use systems well adapted to the environmental restriction of the Mediterranean region, characterised by low edaphic and climatic potential (Pinto-Correia, 2000, Olea y San Miguel, 2006). The agrosilvopastoral systems found in southwest Spain and in southern Portugal are characterised by the dispersion of individual or grouped trees associated with animal grazing and cultivated areas. In the dehesas the trees are Mediterranean evergreen cork or holm oaks. It is primarily used for extensive or semi-extensive cattle farming, which utilizes not only the herbaceous pastures, but also the trees by lopping the twigs and fruits. This paper tries to reconstruct the area occupied by the dehesa landscape during the middle of the 20th century in the province of Jaén (Spain) and the evolution of this area up to our modern time. By interpreting the aerial photography of the area we will try to identify the typologies and the area of dehesa in the 1950s. Two digital land cover sets (1956/7-2007) obtained from aerial photographs and digital orthoimages were used. The information was transferred into a geographic information system using ArcGis 10 for the spatial and statistical analyses. In the province of Jaén, the dehesas are up against two interrelated processes: the olive tree monoculture expansion and the abandonment of the dehesas because of their low rentability. We expect to be able to identify the original areas occupied by the dehesa, the areas where the dehesa survives, and the areas which have been replaced with other landscapes.

AB  - The paper focuses on how gated communities, as private means of providing public infrastructure and security, real estate products and club-economies, produce changes in housing market patterns. Based on an empirical study of Los Angeles (California) data, it aims to trace to what extent gates and walls favor property values and if the presence of gated communities produces over time (1980-2000) a deterrent effect on non-gated properties abutting the enclave, or close to it. Resulting from a demand for security, gated communities are a leading offer from the homebuilding industry. But their spread emerges from a partnership between local governments and land developers. Both agree to charge the homebuyer with the cost of urban sprawl (construction and maintenance costs of infrastructure within the gates). Such a structuring of residential space is particularly desirable on the urban edges, where the cost of urban sprawl exceeds the financial assets of local public authorities. New private developments provide local governments with new wealthy taxpayers at almost no cost. As compensation, the homebuyer is granted private and exclusive access to sites and amenities (lakes, beaches, etc.). Such exclusivity favors the location rent, and usually positively affects the property values within the gated enclaves. But it is also assumed that operating cost of private governance are paid for by the increase of property values. Market failure nevertheless occurs when costs rise above sustainable levels compared to property values. Changes produced by gates yield to at least two outcomes. At first sight, residential enclosures produce a price premium, thus being a smart investment. Furthermore, gated communities might well be able to generate enough property value to pay off the price of private governance. But this analysis holds only on a short term basis. In the long term, larger and wealthier gated communities are successful in shielding their property values and generate enough revenue to pay the cost of private governance, whereas a majority of average middle class gated enclaves do not succeed in creating a significant price premium, and / or did not maintain significant price growth during the last decade. Such gated neighborhoods are at risk of a market failure in the private provision of urban infrastructure, leading to potential decay.

AB  - The standard Urban Economics model (Alonso, Muth, Mills) describes analytically an equilibrium of household location in urban areas. We build an agent-based model able to reach this equilibrium in a dynamic way. This allows us to simulate the development of a city by a combination of heterogeneous agents (based on income and preferences for the amenities), transport time cost and amenities locations. We explore the conditions under which non-trivial residential patterns and urban social structure can be obtained.

AB  - The lack of data and the persistent segmentation of spatial mobility approach handicap the understanding of the logics of urban settlement in Senegal. Focusing on the various forms of spatial mobility (international migrations, internal migrations, intra-urban mobilities) in the approach of urban change, we propose a new reading of the recent settlement in Dakar. Since the 1980s, Dakar urban area has been significatively concerned with both demographic and housing transformations. The landscape of the city is marked by the consolidation of the built-up areas, the verticalisation of the housing environment and urban sprawl. These transformations take place in a new context of urban populating in which the role of demographic factors requires a careful revision. The internal migrations which have been a key to the growth of the city and its spatial extension seem to be less determining than the natural growth of the urban population. Our aim in this paper is to stress on the demographic redistribution which takes place at the intra-urban scale and to question the functions of residential spaces in the dynamics of urban settlement.

AB  - <r2r:ml lang="ru"><p class="resumeru" dir="ltr">Production of urban space is assumed to be a rent seeking activity, carried out by many developers who are constantly trying to get the best possible assessment of market and spatial features in order to better produce profit. Developers act locally, that is, they can choose their locations from all over the city, although they do not have a perfect foresight. Different urban locations prompt different types of development, e. g. several housing, commercial, industrial types, although each location can support more than one type development. The more structured the city is, the narrower is the type choice; on the contrary, in areas scarcely occupied the degree of freedom and unpredictability is larger. Developers compete to each other for locations where the land price is lower; in fact land is considered the single most important component of the development, in the sense that it is the only one whose price can vary and hence affect the price of the final good. Developers &quot;invent&quot; new locations constantly, by buying cheap land, investing on it and selling the resulting built space at higher prices. As soon as a developer discover a new location, others follow, making the land price to rise and the advantage to disappear. The resulting urban development is uneven and generally unpredictable; however, urban areas can be assessed from the point of view of its stability, or its resistance to change. A model has been tried out, as follows.<br />Urban space is disaggregated in units of public space, each one presenting a certain level of urbanisation (infrastructure and built form), what affords a measure of spatial differentiation. Built form is also distinguished by their typological affiliation, so that the stocks are classified according to categories, precisely the ones taken on by developers. Moreover, stocks are also characterised by vintages, so that their actual market value can be updated after each iteration. The urban system is constituted by a network of public spaces, each one affording development of a certain number of types. This affordance is more restrict in the inner parts of the city and more open in the parts of scarce development or in sharp decay. The model tries to simulate the action of developers, either by giving them a profit goal or by fixing a urban growth preview. Decision making process is very simple; it involves choosing among different location alternatives the one which allies lowest costs (land and stocks to be devaluated) with highest values (more profitable building types). As developers compete and developments change the spatial affordances, dynamics of space production results unstable and shifting. </p></r2r:ml>

Compared to what already exists, OASIS displays several advantages. Firstly, it is a complete platform that proposes new tools and includes a very large range of standard tools currently scattered in several software and interfaces. Secondly, OASIS provides access to a series of variables frequently used in the literature on spatial inequalities and segregation, which are available here at municipal scale for the entire metropolitan France (base maps included). Lastly, OASIS brings forward novel tools that allow for the testing of the statistical significance of all segregation and auto-correlation indexes with the help of Monte Carlo simulations. To our best knowledge, this kind of fully automatized tools are nowhere available, despite the obvious importance of ensuring the statistical reliability of spatial analyses.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to better understand the decisive factors of the daily walking practices in urban areas. It is based on the hypothesis that the urban morphology determines partially the walking practices by producing the quality of the pedestrian accessibility. The test of this hypothesis uses original data for Besançon and Lille. These data, describing walking practices, including the itineraries, have been collected through two telephone surveys and implemented in a Geographical Information System. According to our work hypothesis, it turns out that high accessibility for pedestrians from their homes tends to promote the use of walking. The analysis of the travels which could be done on foot, but which are actually done by an other mean of transportation, confirms the role of the structure  : it shows that the efficiency of the street network influences the walking practices, particularly the modal choice. Besides, the level of pedestrian traffic, either local or transit, turns out to depend partly on the quality of the local pedestrian accessibility, all the more because the urban structure is organised around a single centre. Finally, among the geometrical criteria of the ground occupation likely to account to the pedestrian traffic, the spatial fragmentation appears to be an influential variable to emphasise the use of  walking.

AB  - Criminality and feeling of insecurity are growing up in the capital-city of Mozambique: Maputo. Statistical indicators on the subject, with which we have to be very cautious, are fostered by the discourses of part of the civil society as well as the public and private security actors. Urban violence is amplified by its emerging character in a sudden neo-liberal context and increasing social inequalities. However, criminality in town cannot be understood without the historical national background. On the field, crime distribution proceeds along a target/refuge area division. Nevertheless, this colonial urban split has to be reconsidered. Local particularities have spatially a higher and more complex incidence on the phenomenon. The public authority has not the capacity to curb this expanding criminality, especially as it suffers from a negative image. In response, the civil society adheres to varied alternative security devices, which are generally linked to the private sphere. What is interesting to note is that the private security follows the social and economical urban groups. In the end, a kind of “territorialization” of urban reactions against criminality emerges today in Maputo.

What are the geographical ideas of Reclus, who deals in his monumental work with hundreds of Jewish communities, on their territorial status, and more broadly on the stateless peoples ? What are his political ideas, which we can infer from his articles and correspondences, on the pogroms and the other persecutions suffered by the Jews ?

That is why, in order to cope with floods, city managers claim to implement new actions to improve the resilience of their territory. At the same time, resilience raises many academic debates on its definitions and operational relevance. Thus, this article shows that resilience elusiveness raises operational issues. Moreover, the absence of a systemic approach of Dublin flood risk management, highlighted by a technical networks resilience analysis, illustrates the difficult consideration by practitioners of a non-stabilized concept in the academic field.

Landsat satellite images are analysed for extracting continuously built-up areas. Estimations of the built-up surfaces are provided for about fifty urban agglomerations from 1980 to 2000. They are then compared to population figures given by different data bases in a variety of international sources. Non linear relationships between surfaces and population are computed. They demonstrate that our estimations of surfaces are consistent and reliable. However, the evolutions of surfaces as well as population figures are too variable to be reliable. Consequently the same method cannot be used and has to be supplemented with other sources.

AB  - Spain has been profoundly transformed by the well-known socio-political and economic changes that have taken place since the end of 1978. In a few short years, the old autocratic State was converted into an important capitalist and liberal economy fully adapted to the commitments of the European Union. Throughout the course of the last decade of the twentieth century, the consequences of full incorporation into the European Union and the effects of globalisation contributed to the modification of social structures in the Spanish city of the twenty-first century. Determining economic and cultural factors play a decisive role in the rising numbers of immigrants from Africa, Asia and Latin America, but other geographic factors and factors related to location make Spain an attractive place to settle in for retired seniors from other parts of Europe with medium and high purchasing power. This paper focused in the study of immigration in Spain in different scales. Interregional and interurban analyses are based in two territories with a different socio-economic level and demographic behaviour: the Autonomous Communities of Balearic Islands and Castile and León and the cities of Palma de Mallorca and León.

However this concept does not mean that water management is spatialised : water management seldom influences the way territory is occupied.

AB  - Rap music was born in the black marginalized neighborhoods of American cities. If this kind of music has since been commercialized, globalized, and transformed, the link to the city remains strong in places such as the Twin Cities (Minneapolis / Saint Paul), through the idea of “representing” the “hometown”. Discourses and practices of the members of the rap scene reveal how this culture takes its roots in the local context and how it is reshaped at the same time. The specificities of the Twin Cities are also used, particularly in the lyrics, to challenge the image of the city. Thus, rappers strive to demonstrate the legitimacy of the local scene at the national level, in order to “put the Twin Cities on the map of rap in the United States”.

AB  - The Greater Paris area has a direct influence over its administrative boundaries. It constitutes an integrated metropolitan area. Figures such as the commuting pattern or the presence of integrated firms are convincing proofs of the existence of a huge functional region, economically integrated. Beside, the industrial pattern shows a vast and complex organisation made of functional and sector complementarities (companies are spread over the basin, places are specialized, activities are concentrated). If there are specific patterns at a local level, the regional organisation is to be noticed. Hence, due to sector specialisations the Parisian basin is not hierarchical.

AB  - The malaria remains a public health problem in spite of the implemented means. Among the existing information related to malaria prevention in the Gabon, there has a gap concerning the colonial period. Through a synthesis of the organization of this malaria prevention for 5-14 years, the aim of this study is to fill this lack in this target population and to supply information of decision-making support. In spite of the gaps in the data, the use of archives reveals that the activities of malaria prevention are differently led by the concerned institutions: the Indigenous Medical Care first, and the General Service of Mobile Hygiene and Disease Prevention then. Both departments had same kind of functioning problems, but the second focused on preventive activities. They evaluate the chemotherapy program in school, by measuring splenic index in june and october (at the beginning and at the end of scholar year). This index was approximately two times less in june than in october in most regions. In addition, the more regions are far from coast, the more the index is high. This program result on pupils absence fall’s and was completed by imagocid and anti-larval control. Children aged 0-5 who also participated to this distribution can’t be controlled because they parents don’t often bring them at pediatric nursing’s. The General department of mobile hygiene and prophylaxis furthermore, organized a survey, at the end of colonization, to update some epidemiological information’s and the geography of endemicity.

AB  - Cotton countryside in the Western Burkina Faso has rapidly evolved over the last fifty years. Agrarian and demographic transition has led to an important decline in bush areas. A phase of photo interpretation was conducted on a spatial extent comprising a dozen villages along the protected area of the Tui. After a description of spatial patterns with the help of various indicators (shape, structure ...), a summary of the interactions between the protected area and humanized places is proposed. This study shows that even if this area has been protected for 50 years, rules of access to this area have evolved. The rights for cropping of in the 1950’s and 60’s did not exist, and fields eviction were accelerated in the 1990’s. The agrarian transition coupled with strong desire of protection produce then a recent differentiation of two units, one agricultural and one of nature conservation. On this scale of observation, space competition seems to be important. A second approach based on cycles crop/fallow to a finer scale then distinguishes different spatial and dynamics patterns. This broader scale shows that the large increase in cultivated area does not lead to bush extinction. Some farm units continue the practice of shifting cultivation. Ultimately, this work highlights the importance of the relationship between spatial and temporal scales for studying dynamics in this region.

These indexes increase during the late morning and afternoon but decrease on the evening, thus improving thermal comfort. The THW Index incorporates the wind speed parameter. This index is lower than the previous two in the afternoon because the sea breeze speed is around 5m/s. Temperatures and thermal comfort indexes recorded in daytime are colder in coastal than in continental areas. Coastal area temperatures and thermal comfort indexes are deeply dependent on the sea-breeze diurnal cycle. During the hot season, see-breeze improves thermal comfort in a better way than sirocco wind.

AB  - Industrial accidents are a major risk in many countries. Despite this observation, effective preventive action is not being developed and studies of the behaviours of vulnerable populations remain under-explored. According to safety instructions, residents must take shelter and remain indoors but other behaviours may be observed such as: running away from the affected area, panicking, or following people around. In order to assess the attitudes of people and the effects of local contingencies that could interfere with official advice in the event of a toxic cloud, a specific agent-based model called TOXI-CITY has been developed. The aim of this explorative model is to determine whether a minimum number of well-informed agents (i.e. those who follow the emergency protocol) can save a maximum number of uninformed and impressionable ones. Simulations indicate that the initial number of agents and the spatial configuration of the grid strongly influence final survival rates. A non-linear pattern emerged: survival rates increase when well-informed agent rates are low (below 30%) while increasing the percentage of informed agents (from 70%) seems to improve only slightly the chances of survival.

AB  - The paper describes the development of a prototype Synoptic Prediction System (SPS) for the European Union (EU) funded Mediterranean desertification and land use project (MEDALUS III). The prototype SPS was designed to forecast the possible impacts of global climatic change on agricultural land use patterns across the Mediterranean region of the EU. Designing such a system was a challenging task because many of the theoretically desirable data sets were either unavailable or did not exist, whilst significant uncertainties were apparent in the available data. Additionally, process knowledge was woefully deficient as virtually all the principal mechanisms for linking the dynamics of the climate and physical environment with the associated socio-economic systems were poorly understood. In order to make the best predictions of the geographical impacts of climatic change for around 75 years hence we developed an integrated, synoptic, GIS, scenario based modelling approach as we believed it was the best available option. So, the paper describes the development of a prototype Synoptic Prediction System (SPS) which employs a mix of GIS, neurocomputing, and fuzzy logic technologies to attempt the almost impossible yet important task of forecasting agricultural land degradation risk under various climate change scenarios. The paper focuses on methods developed to enrich the available data, the quantitative approach to modelling and forecasting land use using neural networks, and the fuzzy logic based translation of the modelling results into land degradation terms.

AB  - The evolution of the urban systems shall pass different stages. The firs is the formation of hole system than the conformity to the rank-size rule is improving. The second is the transition from the quasi-amorphous state to the quasi-crystalline state than the conformity to the rank-size rule is getting worse, but the conformity to the central place theory is improving. The relativistic central place theory makes interdependent the spacing of the central places and their size. The attractor of the evolution of the central places systems is the state of isostatic equilibrium – the complete compensation of the deviation from the theory predictions by the spacing of the central places. The size of the central places is determined by the another way than in the classical theory. The type of Christaller’s hierarchy – the K – is depending on the degree of the urbanisation and is to change during the evolution of the central systems. So that the virtual hierarchies K=5 and K=6 which are not conforming to any optimization principle do exist. Than the urban population is below 50% K=3, if it is between 50% and 60% - K=4, for 70 – 80% K=5, if it is about 90% - K=6 and the extreme quantity of the urban population – 100% is corresponding to K=7. The evolution of the central places systems is closely related with the transition of urban systems from one Gibbs stage of urbanisation to another and with the evolution of transport networks. Many national and regional urban systems were studied in order to test these statements and the results were satisfactory.

AB  - The Tricastin region (France - Drôme and Vaucluse Departments) is one of the regions for which the most information on the ancient agrarian structure is available. It is the only region of the Roman Empire for which there exists a rural cadastral plan drawn up during antiquity (the B Cadastre of Orange), and of which fragments have been found engraved on marble slabs. This incomplete but extremely precise cartography represents a regular breakdown of the land into square units (centuries), still partially perceptible in the landscape , transferred onto a summary geographical backdrop on which the water courses are distinguished from the major roads. This exceptional and unique information has been supplemented by an archaeological map drawn up from field and air surveys, and from recent observations made during the arachaelogical survey carried out along the layout of the future Mediterranean TGV railway line. Given this situation, it is interesting to determine the specific contribution that satellite remote sensing can make towards the information obtained from the geo-archaeological investigation and the archaeomorphology based on cartography and photointerpretation. The result of the interpretation of certain processing operations shows the advantage and the cpacity of remote sensing to supplement information obtained from photointerpretation and archaelogical digs.

AB  - This paper assesses the usability of land prices as an indicator of the efficiency by which different delineations of a given city capture the influence area of that city. The case study used is Brussels (Belgium). A hedonic model of land prices (log-linear and semi-parametric specifications) is estimated for 12 different delineations of the city and on automatically constructed delineations. The assumption, grounded in the Alonso-Muth model, is that when local amenities have been controlled for, accessibility to the CBD parameter estimate will reflect the city influence on its delineation. Results show that both the size and composition of the delineations of Brussels influence the land price determinants. The size changes the spatial structure of land prices, which is best described by Hoyt’s sector model for narrow definitions of Brussels, and by Alonso-Muth type model for larger definitions. Composition induces variations in the magnitude of the influence of accessibility to the CBD on land prices, due to the presence of secondary centres or rural areas. The lack of detailed data on land prices limits the robustness of the results. Nevertheless, our findings show the potential of land prices as a tool for comparing delineations of a city, or to draw delineations of that city. Finally, they also suggest that delineations based on fluxes (e.g. commuting), and on endogenous thresholds, are more adequate to capture the influence area of a city than those based on transport infrastructure or administrative delineations.

AB  - This paper presents the main contributions of an agent-based approach for modelling and simulating the processes of diffusion in geographical space. This approach is compared with the macro modeling traditionally employed to describe such phenomena. The logistic model is thus presented as representative of this category of model. The agent-based models represent a possible alternative to a macroscopic approach of the processes of diffusion. Related to the theories of self-organization, it is assumed that the phenomena observed on a certain level are the result of the many interactions which occur on one or more lower levels. As a simulation tool predisposed to the analysis of such a dynamic, the multi-agents systems are briefly presented. This paper ends with a brief example of application, the modeling and the simulation of the diffusion of an agricultural innovation (Hägerstrand's model revisited).

Relying on Justice Theories, a description of an economic measure of inter-individual distance is provided, where emphasis is put on the utilitarian definition of well-being. In this framework, urban segregation could be appraised as the conjunction of geographical distance within the city and this economically-defined distance. Using fiscal data and the 2006 Population Census, an application is supplied for Île-de-France, in order to highlight the empirical discrepancies or complementarities of the standard and the economic conceptions of segregation. While no major discrepancies are observed, the economic point of view allows for a generalization of some of the standard approach results, and also provides additional evidence on segregation in Île-de-France.

AB  - Geographic information systems includes among the variety of analytical fonctions those intended to spatial-temporal modelling and decision support, particullary multi-criteria evaluation and multi-objective evaluation. These tools are particularly useful for simulation scenarios because of reproducibility of results and the possibility to define the amount of trade off and risk in the decision process. This paper focuses on methodology and results obtained for retrospective land cover modelling in the Alpujarra Alta Granadina (Andalusia, Spain), related to a knowledge database about land cover dynamics up from the XVI century to XX century. Multi-criteria evaluation produces a lot of land use potencial maps, also called suitability maps, one for every objective (land use category). It is based on a chronological set of land use maps, and criteria which are considered responsible for the observed changes and aptitude to receive an agricole use. After that, the multi-objective evaluation resolves the incompatibilities between the potentials uses for the chronological set (1572, 1752, 1855/61), and rebuilt probabilistic historical maps based in the statisticals surfaces. The results show the probable location for a specific use and allow to test the methodology and to specify some contributions and limits without for it permitting a validation for lack of historic comparable documents.

AB  - Since the introduction of plague in Madagascar by europeans settlers, research on the Madagascar epidemiologic cycle has been focussing upon the comprehension of the transmission process between the main host, rats, and the secondary one, humans, via a vector, fleas. This process is now well known, thanks to the experimental method. Nowadays, research integrates a new approach, derived from artificial intelligence techniques and founded upon sciences of complexity, to analyse emergence, reemergence, conservation and diffusion of plague in its environment, in order to improve its control. The aim of our paper is to present this new approach of plague, replaced in its historical context, and based on multi-agent modeling.

AB  - This study examines the use of Remote Sensing (RS) technology in geological studies in El Azraq area. LandSat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) and Radar SAR images were used to (i) classify the various geological units found in El Azraq area located in the North-East of Jordan, (ii) discriminate the lithology and structure of this area, and (iii) delineate the associated zones of hydrothermal alteration. A wide variety of digital image processing techniques were applied such as the Principal Components (PC) analysis, ratioing and Intensity, Hue and Saturation (IHS) transformation. The color composite of Principal Components (1, 2, and 3), the ratio images (3/1, 4/3, and 5/7) and the IHS (1, 3, 5) enabled us to determine the different types of igneous rocks in the study area.  A remote sensed lineament map was produced using two different methods:  (i) application of directional filters and edge enhancement; and (ii) data fusion of ETM+ with SAR image. The selective PC analysis of ETM+ using bands 1, 3, 4, and 5 was used in mapping iron and iron oxide bearing minerals. The same method was also applied using bands 1, 4, 5, and 7 for hydroxyl bearing minerals detection. Finally, the hyper spectral technique was used for detecting the different minerals in the study area based on the spectral library of minerals.

AB  - This research focused on the economic transfers between a university and its local and regional setting, assessing how research and higher education activities contribute to local economic development. Interactions between university research and businesses are enhanced by spatial proximity, especially in the case of the largest universities within metropolitan regions. What are the effects of a smaller university associated with a medium-sized town? We studied the case of Pau University (UPPA), investigating all interactions between university research and the social, economic and cultural fabric of the area. The results show that Pau University has a real impact on the local region in several complementary ways. We identified an economic relationship corresponding to the transfer of knowledge and research methods and capability from Pau University to local businesses. Secondly, a strong component of the local cultural fabric is the socio-cultural incorporation of scientific knowledge by the general public which serves as a resource for the entire region. The economic and cultural transfers mainly benefit to the local area, the urban zone around Pau, and by this way the University is a driving force behind local development.

AB  - Since the beginning of the 90s, different French cities and regions have been organised to host film shooting teams. In a way to help them to choose the different film settings, the city is "cut" by the local authorities into "selected pieces", presented on different materials (Books, CD-ROMs, SIG, etc.). Our hypothesis is double : first, these materials both create and communicate a new idea of urban aesthetics, which does not obey to the classical aesthetic codes of current urban communication materials. These are not the "aesthetics of conformity" of the urban marketing brochures or materials, but "anti-aesthetics" exploiting any different, trouble, or original element. Second, local authorities tend to exploit these cinematographic aesthetics : they thus try to show the city as it has been caught by the camera. "Cinema eye" gives an added value to places which had not an a priori recognised aesthetic quality. We speak about the "city as a setting" because we thing that the different initiatives taken by the local authorities in a way to attract film shooting tend to transform the city into a gigantic setting. Material created in this occasion (brochures, books, CD-ROMs) "cut" the city into photographic sequences, which are characterised, legended, commented. In a context in which, thanks to television, cinema, internet, urban experience tends to be less and less real, and more and more virtual, the question of the creation of urban image and aesthetics by the cinema becomes extremely important.

AB  - <r2r:ml lang="fr"><p class="resume" dir="ltr">L’analogie entre l’apartheid et la situation en Israël-Palestine envahit les commentaires et les analyses. Elle prend cependant différentes formes. L’usage radical et systématique de l’analogie vise à condamner l’Etat d’Israël et le sionisme dans leur nature même. Cette approche infondée est aisément réfutable par l’analyse comparée des deux systèmes politiques et sociaux, y compris la discrimination des Arabes israéliens par rapport à celle des non Blancs en Afrique du Sud de l’apartheid. L’usage conjoncturel à visée critique ou constructive de l’analogie s’applique quant à elle exclusivement au traitement des Territoires occupés par Israël et fait référence à la politique du « grand apartheid » et ses bantoustans. Bien que s’appuyant sur quelques éléments communs, cet usage de l’analogie ne résiste pas à une analyse technique et contextualisée des ingénieries territoriales et politiques. Là où le « grand apartheid » relevait d’un système politico-territorial profondément raciste mais de nature postcoloniale, la politique israélienne vis-à-vis des Territoires occupés et plus généralement le sionisme contemporain, apparaissent comme un nationalisme de pratique coloniale, au sens étroit du terme (primat de l’appropriation foncière et de l’annexion sur les autres formes de domination). Les perspectives de résolution du conflit font également l’objet d’approches comparatives qui s’intéressent à l’expérience sud-africaine. Là aussi l’analogie entre les deux situations offre peu de points communs sur lesquels s’appuyer pour concevoir les modalités d’un compromis géopolitique et d’une réconciliation. En revanche, le rapport renouvelé au territoire et à la souveraineté, esquissé à Genève, relève d’un post-sionisme territorial qui semble porteur de solutions.</p></r2r:ml>

This document does not contain a date neither a signature, so the first problem is to make the most compelling hypothesis about that. The second problem is to evaluate the relevance of this source: does it contain relevant novelties for the personal, political and scientific biography of Reclus? Finally, we propose an integral transcription of this text: we think that it is a pleasant reading.

Moreover, some micro-GIS have interesting development possibilities through plug ins, in the common programming languages : Pascal, C, Delphi, etc… On this basis, we have complemented functions of one micro-GIS (spatial requests, itinerary calculation, data managing, cartography) with a set of statistical and graphical modules. These tools give to users all statistical informations and graphical representations that are necessary for a comprehensive data analysis. Interactive links between modules allow a global approach, and the comparison and merging of different methods of analysis. Lastly, the associated map is triggered anytime clusters of individuals are defined. Indeed, we do have a complete interactivity between GIS, maps, and statistical modules. However, we plan to go further in experimenting of other graphic tools, especialy in the exploitation of factor analysis results.

It appears necessary to open more the methods of regional and space analysis to the comprehension of the phenomena of the space change and the localization of the economic sectors. According to the results, the most significant moments of reorganization of the Brazilian Southern region occurred during the years between 1950 and 1960 and 1970 to 1980. In the specific case of diversification, this one ensures a lighter fall in the moments of crisis of a specific economic sector. The specialized region is more fragile with the crises but is generally more dynamic when the business cycle is fixed in its specialization.

AB  - Likeness and proximity are studied in the particular context of geographical discontinuity, in both clustered (bounded) and continuous spaces. First, likeness and proximity are linked: likeness could be spatial and/or social; moreover, social structures influence proximities, and, conversely, proximity influence not only structures, but flows as well. Two options are available when measuring likeness of places at close range. One is couple-of-places-analysis; other is a particular smoothing method. This method allows computing a "heterogeneity vector" / "directed heterogeneity index", useful when mapping discontinuities. Despite existing varieties of geographical discontinuities are more or less sensitive to time and spatial scale change, morphology of discontinuities is an important matter: form of the discontinuity influences the development of the circumscribed system.

AB  - <r2r:ml lang="ru"><p class="resumeru" dir="ltr">The aim of this study is to explore the determinants of long-distance commuting as compared to shorter commuting distances. Long-distance commuters are defined as individuals with a Euclidean distance of 200 kilometres or more between their hous-ing and work place coordinates. With the increase in dual-earner households, long-distance commuting has emerged as a mobility strategy to manage the growing dis-tances between home and work places. The empirical analysis is based on a sample from a longitudinal micro database containing demographic, socio-economic and geographic information for the total Swedish population. The sample includes all in-dividuals in gainful employment in the age group 19 to 64, with valid geographical coordinates of residence and work place in 1994. A binomial logit model is estimated to capture the effects of variables related to the individual, the kind of work and the labour market, the household, and the geographical context. The results of the analy-sis show that the long-distance commuter is more likely to be male, younger, have at least three years of university education, previous experience of long-distance com-muting, a very low or a very high income, a spouse with a university degree, no chil-dren, and is less likely to live in a detached house. He/she is also more likely to live in a larger city or its hinterland and work within certain occupational sectors. Previous experience of long-distance commuting in particular turns out to have a strong posi-tive effect on the probability of being a long-distance commuter. A concluding dis-cussion on the mobility strategies and the life-style of long-distance commuters sug-gests the diversity of driving forces to be found in individual and household prefer-ences, and structural factors.  </p><p class="resumeru" dir="ltr">Le sujet de l’étude est d’explorer les facteurs déterminants des déplacements pendu-laires sur de longues distances en comparaison de ceux effectués sur de plus courtes distances. Les navetteurs de longue distance sont les individus dont les coordonnées de leur lieu de résidence et lieu de travail sont séparées d’une distance minimum de 200 kilomètres. En réponse à l’augmentation du nombre de ménages double-actifs, les déplacements pendulaires sur une grande distance sont apparus comme une stratégie de mobilité pour gérer les distances croissantes entre le foyer et le lieu de travail. L’analyse empirique est basée sur un échantillon extrait d’une base de données longi-tudinales et individuelles qui regroupe les informations démographiques, socio-économiques et géographiques de l'ensemble population suédoise. L’échantillon com-prend tous les individus, qui en 1994 appartiennent à la classe d’âge 19-64 ans, ont un emploi rémunéré, et dont les coordonnées géographiques de leur lieu de résidence et de travail sont valides. L’estimation d’un modèle <em>logit</em> binomial a permis de prendre en compte les effets des variables liées à l’individu, au foyer, et au contexte géographique. Les résultats de l’analyse montrent que le navetteur de longue distance a plus de chance d’être un homme, jeune, ayant effectué au moins trois ans d’études supérieures, qui a eu une expérience antérieure de déplacement domicile-travail sur de longues distances, a de très bas ou de très hauts revenus, a un conjoint diplômé d’études supérieures, n’a pas d’enfant, et a moins de chance de vivre dans une maison pavillonnaire. Il ou elle est plus susceptible de vivre dans une petite ou moyenne ville, et de travailler dans certains secteurs professionnels. Plus particulièrement, l’expérience précédente de déplacement domicile-travail sur de longues distances apparaît avoir un effet positif important sur la probabilité d’être un navetteur de lon-gue distance. En conclusion sur les stratégies de mobilité et sur les styles de vie des navetteurs de longue distance, il est possible de suggérer que la diversité des forces motrices doive être trouvée dans les préférences de l’individu et celles de son foyer, et dans les facteurs structurels. </p></r2r:ml>

AB  - Most models of residential mobility describe observed behaviour as a function of socioeconomic and demographic covariates of the households involved and an error term. This term encompasses both unobserved constraints on the housing market and omitted variables. For theoretical and policy reasons the unobserved constraints are a major weakness. Overt behaviour of movers is treated as "revealed"preferences. In reality actual behaviour is a function of preferences of the household involved and the availability and accessibility on the spatial housing market. This implies also that no account is made of delay of moves or accepting what is available instead of what is highly preferred. This last type of behaviour is referred as substitution. A change of the availability and accessibility of supply will influence behaviour, but will be unobserved in the estimations. The objective of this article is summarize the results of a research project on bridging the gap between models that measure 'castle in the air' and model that measure ' my house is my castle'. The methode used is the Decision Plan Net.

AB  - According to the classification of S.Rokkan, four cleveages have generated political parties in democraties : church/secular, center/periphery, owners/workers and rural/urban cleveages. The rural/urban cleveage is the most recent and has produced fewer parties than the other divisions. Nevertheless, the growth of green parties is sometimes associated to electoral urban structuration and we can suppose that the apparition of a agrarian party in France («Chasse, Pêche, Nature et Tradition») is related to a rural structuration. To test the hypothesis of the influence of urbanisation on the localisation of «les Verts» and «CNPT», we’ll use spatial analysis methodology at two different scales : France by «canton» and Basse-Normandie by «commune». Our goal is to illustrate the actual electoral realignement in the occidental democraties (both decline of the great parties and the class vote, relative decrease of the «left wing/right wing» cleveage, votes on particular stakes) and to demonstrate that this changes are produced by new spatial patterns.

AB  - Since several decades, French urbanisation evolves in a way that can hardly be seen favourable to public transportation. Innovation is needed in this field, if the individual automobile is to be faced on its own territories. This need for innovation concerns the miscellaneous stages of the public transport production, including the preliminary analysis ones. Indeed, many work remains to be done to understand mobility behaviour, what is more if we are to propose versatile and viable alternatives to current trends. Geomarketing based surveys, combining revealed and stated preferences, are a powerful way of acquiring such an accurate information. From a qualitative point of view, this kind of information allows to calibrate public transport services adapted as much as possible to the targeted customers. However, the major problem of the spatial generalisation of this individual information remains often unsolved. In this context, a strategy is proposed, based on the combination of miscellaneous methods.

AB  - Since the early 1990s, the private furnished rental sector has strongly developed in Paris and its inner suburbs, which is especially due to tax reliefs. This housing sector is now closer to the private unfurnished rental one than to the furnished hotel business with which it used to be associated. Meant for short‑term renting, this form of accommodation is characterized by its centrality and the small surfaces it offers. Moreover, it turns out to be more expensive than the unfurnished sector. The tenants are often young people at the beginning of their residential history. They also often live alone. This growth of the furnished rental sector leads to its gentrification, as it takes place in favor of senior executives, middle‑classes and students, rather than in favor of its traditional low‑class customers. These deep changes go with a redefining of the functions that this sector is bound to play on the real‑estate market of the Paris metropolis.

AB  - This article is based on an experimental participation in one of the research conducted by the European Spatial Planning Observatory Network (ESPON) program on the governance of territorial and urban policies from European Union level to local level. The authors intend to demonstrate the prescriptive nature of the use of the concept of governance within the research program. They conclude that the issue of mobilizing this concept lies in the political willingness of Europeanization of spatial planning. However, the results of the research, because of the normative use of governance, question about the nature of the obtained results. Consequently, the authors make a proposal on what could be a use of the governance as a conceptual tool balancing scientific objectivity and political objective of europeanization of spatial planning via the use of governance in its territorial declension.

AB  - This article proposes a prototype model of urban dynamics in Réunion Island. As input, the model combines a set of geographical fields favourable or unfavourable to urbanization; as output, it indicates for each place an inclination to urbanization. It allows an exploratory analysis of the urban dynamics according to an heuristic approach. The first results have permitted us to obtain a map of the inclination to urbanization concerning the whole island, which is in accordance with the dynamics observed between 1989 and 2002 ; a first dynamics scenario for the savanes’ areas in the west of the island is also proposed. These first considerations on the model which is in a preliminary stage, are encouraging. Howewer they raise many questions, notably about factor calibration and their respectif roles, the taking into account of new fields for example the neighbourhood, the analysis of the residuals, the evaluation of the quality of the model or the use of the model as a supporting tool for land projects.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to briefly describe the recent advances in the graphs theory using the concept of the minimal spanning tree in geomorphometric terms. The description of the distribution of a grouping of nodes in geographical space can be realised mathematically, giving rise to eleven distinct morphometric classes. These classifications constitute the basic spatial models from which it is possible to measure the rate of disorder, which is the deviation from the model. Other constructs than that of order/disorder in spatial organisation are also analysed. With a spatial quantification table, one is able to observe in a single table the models important to the space being analysed and their different rates of disorder.

AB  - The time-scales over which significant environmental changes take place can vary from a few hours on highly mobile coastal sediments to tens or even hundreds of years on exposed stone surfaces. Studies of rapidly changing features can be carried out using traditional field monitoring techniques, perhaps aided by airborne or satellite imagery if the scale of change is sufficiently large. Less dynamic surfaces do not lend themselves to such methods since, over the time-scale of traditional research projects, the amount of change will be less than the known errors in the measurement techniques. This paper describes the use of historical aerial photographs to study changes in an inter-tidal environment, around Langstone Harbour and Chichester Harbour (U.K.), and discusses the advantages and limitations of this data source.

AB  - Until now, studies of urbanization in India have been based only on official urban figures as provided by Census surveys. This approach has inevitably introduced several avoidable biases into the picture, distortions which are further compounded by numerous regional inter-Census adjustments. A much sounder option is now available in the Geopolis approach [www.e-geopolis.eu], which follows the United Nations system of classifying as urban all physical agglomerates with at least 10,000 inhabitants. From this standpoint, the Indian scenario exhibits all signs of a much-diffused process of urbanization rather than a major demographic polarization led by mega-cities. While 3,279 units were officially categorized as urban, the Geopolis criterion has identified 6,467 units with at least 10,000 inhabitants. Moreover, Geopolis estimates the urban population at 37% for 2001, which is 10% more than the official Census estimate. In absolute terms, this difference accounts for 100 million inhabitants. Brought to light by both physical identification and gradation of the census units of all localities as well as a study of the morphological profiles of individual agglomerates, a major finding reveals a greater spread of the country’s metro and secondary cities than previously believed. Statistical and political considerations have obscured the emergence of small agglomerations of between 10,000 and 20,000 inhabitants. This omission can only be seen as a gap in the national policy on planning and urban development. In other words, the country seems to be firmly headed toward an extended process of metropolitanization alongside diffused combinations of localized socio-economic opportunities, clusters, cottage industries, and market towns partially interlinked by developmental corridors. Far from a dual model of modern versus traditional, urban versus rural, metro city versus small town, the Indian subcontinent features many sub-regional settings which converge, overlap, and diverge. This study of the distribution of current and emerging agglomerations challenges the pertinence of the urban/rural divide.

AB  - Numerous cities are pursuing large urban projects in order to consolidate both their international reputation and their position in an increasing context of competition between cities. These complex projects involve a multitude of stakeholders; that is, groups or individuals that can affect or be affected by the objectives of the project, including public officers, investors, the civil society, professionals, etc. The comparative analysis of the organizational structure (the set of stakeholders and the relationships between them) and management mechanisms (strategic tools, tactical urban planning methods, tools for citizen participation) in two large urban projects – the Quartier des spectacles in Montreal (Canada) and Lyon Confluence (France) – shows how this structure and these mechanisms determine the level of influence of the different stakeholders on the project. Despite the fact that participation has contributed to informing citizens, building trust, and making decision, the study shows that in both cases, strategic decisions were taken by « urban elites » (Pinson, 2009). Although these « urban elites » are composed by a multiplicity of actors, public authorities in Lyon largely dominate the urban project, whereas in Montreal the project is dominated by both public and private urban elites. Finally, the study highlights the advantages and disadvantages of participation models proposed by S. Arnstein (1969) and UN-Habitat (2009).

In a first part the article shows that gravity accessibility indicators are consistent with the surplus theory. Then gravity accessibility calculations are performed on a case study of the Strasbourg area. These calculations underline the possibility to take into account both the population heterogeneity with a partly disaggregated analysis, and the heterogeneity of transport supply through a detailed zonal approach, with an appropriate GIS. The results underline that GIS are relevant tools for public decision making.

AB  - Recent studies have shown for countries other than Canada that the intra-metropolitan distribution of seniors is changing significantly. In this paper we analyze the evolution of the residential segregation of the elderly population in eight Canadian metropolitan areas from 1981 to 2006. Our analysis was guided by the following research questions. What is the level of segregation of the elderly population, and how has this segregation changed over time? Within these eight metropolises, where are the concentrations of seniors located, and how did these concentrations change between 1981 and 2006? Finally, in 2006, are the patterns of segregation similar across the eight metropolitan areas? In order to answer these questions, various residential segregation indices (evenness, exposure, concentration, clustering, and centralization) are calculated at the census tract level using data from six Canadian censuses for the period 1981-2006. The changes in the values of the location quotients are also mapped to portray the evolution of the spatial distribution of seniors in the three largest metropolises. The changes in the values of the different indices show a decrease in segregation levels in the eight metropolises studied over this period. Moreover, analysis of the changes in the location quotients indicates a relative dispersion of seniors towards the inner suburbs over time. In 2006, we also observe different segregation profiles among the eight metropolises. Finally, several hypotheses are formulated concerning the factors contributing to the changes observed in the spatial distribution of elders.

AB  - Tourism activity is often analyzed using data about arrivals and accommodation capacities in hotels and similar establishments. We contend that these statistics are not sufficient to analyze the tourism phenomena, particularly place attractiveness. In order to fill this gap, we suggest an original indicator of touristic attractiveness at the municipal level, using textual analysis of travel guidebooks. After a review of the literature devoted to the role of guidebooks in shaping tourists destinations, we apply our methodology to the Corsican case (France). Due to linguistic and statistical issues, notably in Corsica, it is crucial to make someone supervise the indicator building process. Moreover, testing our indicator through several guidebooks yields very similar results, suggesting that our indicator is robust. Finally, using multivariate regression and decorrelation technics, we develop an attractiveness indicator that offers a better understanding of tourism activity, compared to more traditional communal statistics and touristic indicators.

AB  - This paper proposes to organize an ongoing geographical field of specific questions on spatial systems around a transdisciplinary cybernetic design. Structured as a developer, it is built on the contradictory antagonistic logic of S. Lupasco and associates the mediance of A. Berque, the dissipative structures of I. Prigogine and the enaction of F. Varela. This screening process allows us to compare the significance of the concrete resilience of the M’zab based solely on water control and that of the world system assessed according to the conceptual indication of the ecological footprint. One arrives at the heuristic necessity to separate a weak cybernetic self-organization through combinations from a strong self-organization through interactive triggers. A guide to geographical research is thus proposed, to the point of suggesting substantial modeling for experimentation. In conjunction with this construct, the outline of a geographical theory of anthropogenesis based on L. Bolk’s neoteny is suggested, which holds to the hypothesis that Homo sapiens sapiens is fundamentally Homo geographicus.

AB  - In Western countries, telework has become a massive work pratice. Nevertheless, despite the media hype of the nineties, it remains largely unknown and mis-understood. Albeit telework is not teleservices, it participates in the same way to the communication and ICT utopia. Actually, teleworkers in the First World number between 10 and 20 % of the workforce. The rise of teleaccess technologies, the demand of business flexibility in the so-called “globalized new economy”, and urban congestion, are the main reasons for telework practices. Field experimentations in large metropolitan areas well reveal telework major stakes : to maintain economic efficiency, ecological sustainability and quality of life. Rural applications of telework are statistically less significant, but support the popular utopia of the return to nature. Telework is fully embedded in the rise of new space/time flexibilities, which result in the confusion of old taxinomies and structures : centre/periphery, urban/rural, workplace/home. For these reasons, telework largely appears as a pervasive, but underground phenomenon.

AB  - The violent storms which occurred in the winter of 1999 (December 26th and 28th) severely hit French forests : 140 million m3 of timber were thrown to the ground, thus destroying a volume equivalent to an average 3 years’ productivity. In Lower Nomandy, the Perche-Trappe forest was one of the most severely hit of the whole French State forest network. It was the finest example of the oak-elm association in Normandy but it also had coniferous species, some of which were unable to resist wind-throw. Massive uprooting generated clearings in which new plant dynamics have manifested themselves. For to assess the extent of these plant dynamics but also with a view to help regeneration and environmental conservation, the Perche Natural Regional Park placed an order with the scientific authority of the Géophen Research Center based in Caen University so that this one carries out an ecological diagnosis in pieces of conifers. This assessment showed strong vegetational regeneration but it also showed that the soil could be impoverished due to compaction. This paper deals with the question of landscape restoration and the means and methods upon which environmental conservation can be based. As users of the land, local farmers could be actively involved in the conservation process, once they have been made aware of the importance of environmental protection.

Our observations will then deal with the multidimensional factors of vulnerability. Great poverty is still a reality in African cities; town dwellers will hence favour survival strategy. At a time where heritage is used as a tool for economical growth, its issue becomes a stake of great importance and occasionally a source of conflicts. The resilience seems to have a moderating influence to vulnerabilities. Examples are taken in world's heritage African cities with case studies in Mali and Ethiopia.

AB  - During the sixties, new artistic practices concerned with ecological issues began to appear. In the United States, one could begin to discover monumental artworks consisting of reforestation, depollution, the reintroduction of flora and fauna in deserted areas. Whilst the question reaches a large audience, certain artists are already aware of the way that ecological rehabilitation, and even their own works, could be manipulated. “Will it be a little easier in the future to rip up the landscape for one last shovelful of non-renewable energy source if an artist can be found (cheap, mind you) to transform the devastation into an inspiring and modern work of art? (Robert Morris). If some artists deliberately choose to pursue their researches together with scientists in order to develop unprecedented solutions, others refuse to abandon their scepticism towards a use of art for ecological purposes. From initial projects which are altogether very consensual, they realise artworks which reveal the ambiguity of working in derelict places and denounce the risks of instrumentalising art for political purposes.

AB  - At the end of the 18th century in Germany, statistics and political geography as fields of knowledge are very similar, particularly because their space approach is centered on the state territory and hence emphasizes the importance of political boundaries in the definition of their subjects. The wars during the revolutionary and imperial era, while disrupting the political map of Europe and of the Holy Empire, make such an approach less and less operative. In the beginning of the 19th century, geographers claim therefore their intention to investigate territories which were delimited by natural boundaries, while the traditional statistics has many difficulties to elaborate a new methodological framework. After 1815 the stabilization of the political situation in Europe leads to a revival of the political geography which is partly based on a « inveigling of the inheritance » of the statistics whose social and scientific legitimacy was weakened. In the same time, the administrative quantifying statistics became established, as the Prussian example shows, and developed its own approach and knowledge of space.

AB  - The night activities in Nancy are very limited and mostly reduced to «leisures» of which the evolution is linked to technical factors such as the lighting´s control, to geographical factors such as the lighting´s distribution in the urban space or the perception of the seasonal obligations of the east climat, but also to sociological factors such as the life´s style or the social composition of the quarters. Today, the «festivals» let the place essentially to the individual leisures in specialized establishments for townspeople looking after «entertainment» when the night left the city to those for whom it becomes the place of phantasm of any kind. In front of an increasing demand for «leisure» and night´s lifespace, this city socially quite searchs for a conciliation between the night´s function of the city –the rest- and the limited night´s entertainment function while progressively the «night» shifts from the previous center (today transformed into a residential function more classical) to the periphery.

AB  - This study takes a micro-sociological look at how pedestrians walk around towns. The aim is to highlight the various ways in which city-dwellers gain access to public places and the practical and perceptive dimensions that this accessibility calls upon. From our point of view urban mobility is based on a process by which pedestrians bond with their surroundings: mobility involves the perceptible environment of the public urban space, the perception of the pedestrian and the ability of his or her body to express itself. It is consequentlynecessary to characterise and describe precisely the ambient atmospheres in which such activities develop, the forms of motive action and perceptive attention they generate, and ultimately the types of relationship with the city that they bring about. Drawing on recurrent observation and description of public behaviour in the city of Grenoble this work proposes six perceptible figures of urban accessibility. Each one reflects the individual rationales of pedestrians and the special role of sensory perception in the choice of one's route across town.

AB  - The purpose of this article is the reflection on land use and occupancy approach after major disasters, using the case of Tabarre, community of the Haitian capital, affected by the earthquake on 12th of January 2010. This earthquake, as did other large-scale events, showed the key place of the soil for crisis management, while this issue is not often addressed. The analysis is based on cartography representing land-use changes in times of crises. We highlight different modification types, opening areas for further reflection on operational scope. We also consider the theoretical value concerning development logic and resilience of urban territories.

AB  - The concept of system is probably deeply rooted in ecological thinking. However, the importance of space in the inetercations within a system is fairly new. In this manuscript, we recall the classical Lotka-Volterra model to model communities of interacting populations, and an historical result by May, linking stability and diversity in randomly connected Lotka-Volterra systems. The concept of permanence is introduced, as well as an interpretation of this result in a case which we hope closer to geographers concern, i.e. when the space plays a key role for commanding interactions. We show that restricting interactions between neighbours has a stabilising effect on a global equilibrium.

AB  - The relationship between space, power and identity has to be mediated by symbols. A symbol is a concrete reality (a building, a statue, a coin, etc.) that communicates something intangible (an idea, a value, a feeling...): consequently, a place of power would be necessarily a symbolic place, which brings the power in the space order and the space in the power order. The symbolic mediations between these different orders of reality are produced and interpreted only in their context of emergence. A place can be considered as “symbolic” whenever it means something to a group of individuals, in such a way that it contributes to give an identity to the group. With examples taken throughout the Americas, this paper investigates how symbolic places are produced and controlled by public authorities, civil societies and economic actors.

AB  - The evaluation of proximity-accessibility is quite different among residents, and among trip purposes. Location choice, as reflected through the decision of buying a house, is partly influenced by perception of accessibility integrating the functionality and the coherence of an intra-urban system. However, theses perceptions can vary in space as well as in time. A better understanding of these perceptions can help improving public policies in urban planning and regional development to satisfy population needs. The paper presents a simple methodology to test and model the spatio-temporal evolution of perception of accessibility to various types of services in order to sustain public decisions in Quebec City.

AB  - This paper deals with the cultural policy and strategy of Rotterdam, in particular with regard to its designation as 'European City of Culture' for the year 2001. Having been a port and manufacturing city for many years, with a large proportion of lowly educated people, the city's first goal has been for many years to ameliorate the cultural climate of the city to the benefit of its residents. Since 1987, however, this cultural policy more and more received a market-oriented emphasis. The eternal rivalry with Amsterdam, the absolute cultural capital of the country, and the expectation that a cultural image would enhance the attractiveness of the city for economic investments, are the main factors in this reorientation. Rotterdam's prospects in the market of international urban tourism are, however, weak, because this city does not possess an attractive historical core. Therefore, modern architecture has become the trademark of Rotterdam.

AB  - In this article, we compare two databases, one providing mobility data (UITP database, 2001), and the other providing population density grid cells at 200m scale for 34 European cities. Looking towards sustainable urban forms, we assess explanatory power of socio-economic and morphological indicators, with respect to seven mobility indicators, including the energy consumption per inhabitant due to transport (base year 2001). We conclude that classical urban indicators (GDP per inhabitant, population density) and more precise morphological indicators (entropy, rank-size slope) are complementary towards such objectives.

AB  - Political borders raise multi-scalar issues. At the border between French Guiana and Brazil, the proposed cross-border bridge over the river Oyapock may lead to different interpretations depending on the scale at which it is considered. On the Guiana Shield scale, French Guiana is in a situation of isolation. Road continuity with Brazil could be a way to open the French-Guianese territory to the South-American continent. However the realities of the network in which the bridge must fit impede this goal of continuity. Eventually, the project sends back to the international scale and to a symbolic dimension: as a cross-border bridge, tool for the revival of international relationships, it pushes the logic of crossing and road continuity behind the one of the breakpoint and of the symbolic contact point between the French and Brazilian territories.

In this context, we examine here the services brought to everyday urban travellers, through the study of the so-called informal commerce or street vending, in selected crossroads in Mexico City’s metropolitan area. We established a classification that, in spite of the fluidity and fuzziness of activities, allows us to understand how the retail offer is precisely adapted to urban life paces, to traffic modes and to the social and geographical features of connecting places.

The application of a geographical analysis method based on local measures of spatial autocorrelation permits to localise black zones. The relevance of the method is considered; a sensibility study of the results to several contiguity levels and to several weight functions is proposed. Results are also compared to those obtained with a statistical method of smoothing (based on kernel estimators). The application of the method to some roads shows its appropriation to the problem of black zones identification.

The PPR flood prone zone in this commune shows some insufficiencies and can be improved by using a more accurate Digital Elevation Model and by considering the wave setup in 100-year water level calculation. The Analysis of the shoreline kinematic and the water level elevation expected for 2100 are taken into account too. The comparison between the building expansion, the flood prone zone and the land use plan shows that the PPR flood prone zone does not stop the increase of the stakes in the hazard area in this commune.

AB  - Street networks shape the urban layout that structures the city spaces and delineates homogeneous urban areas. We focus on the study of urban morphology from a structural analysis of the streets’ network. The work on a geographic model allows formalizing mathematically the street network by using graph theory. The structural analysis of street networks is very useful because it usually produces additional (hidden) semantic information and allows the enrichment of spatial data. The aim of this work is to perform some characterization of the urban fabrics using exclusively street networks as input data. Indeed, the structural properties of streets networks create several effects such as continuity, separation, centrality, proximity, connectivity, symmetry, and adjacency into the urban space. We work on an urban primal graph. On the basis of this real urban graph, we implement two additional artificial graphs. The first one is a “Delaunay triangulated network” and the second one is a “minimum spanning tree”. These graphs correspond to two extreme network morphologies delimiting a morphological continuum. The three graphs are then analyzed using shortest path algorithms. They all have been processed on both a topological and a geometric ways so as to extract some structural and multi-centrality indicators (closeness and betweenness centralities). The results produce some semantic information on the structure of urban fabric. They allow us to emphasize some specific morphological urban structures (organic zones, suburban tree structures) and some urban salient features (main roads and ring roads).

AB  - After its massive introduction in the seventies in France Crassostrea gigas has became the main production of French oyster farming. From the early 1990’s, C. gigas has started to spread many sites of Brittany and Normandy and, thanks to climate warming, its population has dramatically increased leading to a general invasion and to deep changes in ecosystems and biodiversity. A research program called PROGIG has been set up to evaluate the dynamic of this proliferation on French Channel and Atlantic coasts, and to identify its interactions with marine ecosystems and human activities. This paper presents the GIS implemented to integrate the data collected during field surveys of oyster populations, and the results of a spatial analysis of its potential interactions with human activities on coastal zone.

AB  - The state or Rondônia, in the brazilian Amazon, is a region where conflicts between the old politics of agrarian land colonization and the new obligations of environment preservation can be witnessed. Indeed, this region, which has seen a wide effort from the Brazilian state to implant small scale farming in the middle of the rainforest, is today within a huge internationally funded zoning program, officially aiming at a better environment preservation. This paper describes relations and conflicts between the actors involved in land occupation. We take a closer look at this issue by analyzing the Ariquémes/Buritis region case, which allows us to encompass in one glance previously and newly occupied zones. Using a GIS, we can point out discrepancies between the political discourse about the region and the reality, as shown by satellite images. We thus produce cartographic synthesis, highlighting the dynamics at stake in this region.

AB  - Our concrete analysis of the relationships between society and environment in coastal parts of Casamance, Guinea and Guinea Bissau associate two methods to represent a territory and its functioning that link space- and time- dimensions; SPOT's datas and a model with "joined productions" or model of activities. The quantitative model created is nothing else than the systemic approach outcome in the material life field that is closely connected with operational research expressed in very general terms taking space in acount. The analysis's heart is what links men, resources, technics in a changing territory. The term of "material production" does express this linkage, this interface. On the one hand, our researches are dealing with the processes by which humans make use of different forms of raw materials and goods available on their territory at the current of a given time, and on the other hand they are dealing with the result of these processes. So, we have defined a specific semantic and used a linear algebric system, which materializes the connection rules of the processes, that is to say the phenomena of interconnected production and consumption, to build a formal and quantitative representation better adapted than natural language to a systemic and global description of societies' material reproduction. Such formalizations orientate the way of collecting datas, especially in environments where statistics absence is generalised, they stimulate the functioning of a productive system , allow "to draw up the balance sheet" and to apprehend interactions, constraints, limiting factors existing at different levels of the material life functioning and allow to imagine the possible responses to cope with the changes (demographic growth, technical intensification, exodus). It is a contribution to the development "durability" on the lines as the models elaborated by Georgescu Roegen.That kind of quantitative method of analysis of a multifactual universe bound by changes can be in use to help with decisions; but it must be associated with others methods depending on anthropology to explain games and prospects from different actors beyond the material goods uses.

AB  - What could be the role of regional and urban planning in reducing greenhouse gas emissions? For some planners, the climate change mitigation is an opportunity to implement policies that they promote since a long time, but whose implementation is fickle: smart growth, public transportation priority and so on. For some scientists, regional and urban planning could only have very indirect and modest effects on greenhouse gas emissions. A scientific literature review on this topic is presented. Many researchers have described and analyzed the links between local or regional characteristics and energy consumption. The present article shows that planning could only indirectly and modestly contribute to climate change mitigation but contributes however to the social acceptance of energy transition.

The calculation of low flow characteristics constitutes a basic requirement of water resources assessment. According to the French water law, the Mean Monthly Annual Minimum discharges (MMAM) is used to summarize and to assess low flow. In fact, other indices can also be used to manage water resources during drought period and a broad range of different low flow indicators are available. This paper intends to review the variety of low flow definitions, indicators and regulatory thresholds.

AB  - The spreading of fossorial water vole outbreaks in the grasslands of the massif of Jura (France) is a periodic phenomenon which poses many problems to agriculture (pest control) and public health (disease transmission). In this context, researchers try to understand the role of landscape structures. Precisely, the aim of the present study is to analyze the role of certain landscape features in relation to the velocity of the travelling wave spreading. The study site is the plateau of Nozeroy (region of Franche-Comté, France), where animal density estimates were obtained for several dates. The computation of “velocity vectors” allowed to link the density evolution and the landscape data stemed from a multispectral satellite image. Statistical relationships were computed between the velocity and many local factors (accessibility to the grassland, proximity of hedgerows and forests) for several neighborhood sizes. The results show that the bocage is the most important factor which slows down the spreading. Accessibility to the resources is less important and plays a part in the velocity only for high density spreading. Lastly, the forests slow down the spread locally and only for low density populations. These results are interpreted in the light of dispersal modalities in the water voles, and of the regulatory role of predators linked to wooded structures.

AB  - Social and economic changes in urban spaces are the subject of much debate in the area of urban research. This article aims to focus on the spatial aspects of these changes. Using the examples of the eight largest French cities, it shows major changes in the structure of residential segregation between 1968 and 1999. The social space at the beginning of the 21st century is characterised by a new complexity of the urban space, which can no longer be summarised by the three classic dimensions of “social status”, “demographic status”, and “ethnic status” that are traditionally mobilised to describe urban areas. In addition, the study evidences the different processes of redistribution of the population across the urban space, articulating in different manner according to social, demographic and ethnic characteristics of the urban population.

AB  - The concept of resilience has been particularly developed in ecology. It implies the capacity of a system to integrate a perturbation in its functionning, without changing its qualitative structure. This thesis has aimed at an application of this notion and its conceptual framework, to a particular geographical problem setting that is the dynamics of the spatial systems. It is thus mainly a theoretical work, but that has been validated by an empirical study. The Comtat plaines, in the Rhône valley, form a system characterized by a spatial organization that is based on the structuring force of market gardening and orchards that are the main features of its agriculture. The Comtat system has proved to be a pertinent example and has permitted to show the fundamental interest of a resilience approach in geography. This work has consisted in a comparison of the system’s reactions during two series of perturbations. I have especially analyzed the system’s dynamics during the agricultural crisis during the second half of the 19th century and during the recent economical difficulties. The new European context has generated a difficult position for the Comtat system when compared to more competitive rivals, like fruit and vegetable producing regions in Spain or in the Netherlands. One of the goals of this work has been to stress the importance of the fundamental properties that characterize a system, on one hand, and of the decisions at lower levels of the organization, on the other hand, for the system’s dynamics when it is perturbed. A qualitative modelling of different dynamical phases of the system is done in order to assess what kind of system features can explain the maintenance of the system’s macro-geographical structure

AB  - All of our travelling is constrained by the structure of the transportation network. Furthermore, due to differences in their performance (incomplete spatial coverage, variations in the velocity of change), these networks tend to make space non-homogeneous an non-isotropic, that is to say, non-Euclidian. Traditional geometry isthus proving to be more and more inadequate to model space as it is really experienced. Consequently, in order to take account of changes in the relationships between places induced by the networks, we are proposing to analyze their effects based on fractal geometry, which does not assume that space is homogeneous and therefore affords a framework reference different from that of our own environment. We intend to analyze, first, the impact of this network structure in terms of its spatial coverage, then we will attempt to observe how the quality of accessibility to a group of service supply areas is dependent upon the morphology and the operation of the network that links them.

AB  - Residential segregation indexes seem to be unrecognized or rarely used in France. The author suggests a definition of residential segregation indices based on a five specific dimensions classification (evenness, exposure, concentration, clustering, centralization) and a presentation of a Mapbasic application. This application has been integrated in the MapInfo software and it allows the automatic calculation of about twenty residential segregation indices.

AB  - Land-Use and transport interaction models today take an important role as decision-making tools, especially in a context marked by the reinforcement of economical, energy and environmental constraints. If the estimation of transport demand and accessibilities in these models depends on densities, these densities are often viewed as exogenous. This paper intends to render them endogenous by measuring the effect of accessibilities on intra-urban densities in the urban area of Lyon in 1990, 1999 and 2006, and defining an evolution law over time for the coefficients of the model. The successive relax of the hypothesis of spatial homogeneity and monocentrism which characterize the Bussière model and the improvement of the transport cost measure (distance from the centre of the urban area, generalized time, gravity accessibility to jobs) give good static results but do not allow for predicting the evolutions of the population densities at the district level. The selective movements of peri-urbanization and return to the centre that were stressed during this short time are far from being explained by the evolution of accessibility to the centre or to jobs in the urban area. The distribution of densities in this monocentric city depends not only on the accessibility to jobs but also appear to be structured by the centrality and the distribution of the social and spatial amenities, which in part result from the urban policy and the macro-agents decisions.

AB  - In the 1990s, fishing in Mali has attracted a lot of research as regards the inner delta region, but little has been studied in the Upper Niger and even less in the capital city. Yet the part of the Niger river crossing Bamako is a place of still unappreciated intensive fishing with its own territorial, technical and governance specificities. No less than 21 fishermen camps are located on the banks and islands in the capital that contribute to the urban economy. But the spatial and demographic growth of Bamako generates numerous constraints on the fishermen community, among which the access to land property. Thus an ambitious plan for the beautification of the river banks is threatening this activity. The occupation and the future of the fishermen of Bamako deserve to be more thoroughly studied because of the instructive dynamics and innovations observed for both the analysis and the change of this activity within the national economy, as well as for the differing imagined “urbanities” that they highlight.

AB  - The health of the population of Vientiane, the main city in Lao PDR, was assessed by means of a health examination performed in 2000 adults in 2006. The examination focused on chronic diseases (diabetes and hypertension), overweight, deficiency disease (anaemia) and infectious disease (past exposure to flavivirus). These biomedical data were related to the residential neighbourhood. Spatial health disparities can then be observed within the small city of Vientiane: they are closely associated with the level of urbanization of the “villages” (villages are administrative units which constitute the main spatial reference frame for lao people). Multilevel logistic regression models are used to identify the factors responsible for these spatial health disparities. After taking into account their individual characteristics, residents in the more urbanized areas are more affected by diabetes, overweight and obesity, more exposed to flavivirus and less affected by anaemia than those of less urbanized areas. However, the influence that the area of residence has on health should not be regarded as operative in the same manner in all residents in Vientiane: cross-level interactions show that this influence varies according to sex, age and standard of living of Vientiane population. This study therefore underscores the influence of the area of residence on health, but it does not yield to a geographical determinism.

AB  - The geography of boardgames practises, which remains to be written, can not avoid a preliminary research on the games themselves and their inner logic. Within that framework, "traditionnal" boardgames have the interest of being possibly considered models of social reality and lend themselves to an investigation of a geographical nature. The study of the features of these play spaces – scale, metrics, substance – and of the nature of their relationship is a first step towards a typology of games, based on the representations of space conveyed by them. Such a typology is a crucial step towards the writing of a geography of practises.

AB  - The KwaZulu-Natal province is situated at the confluence of the domestic and foreign tourist markets in South Africa. In 2009, the province welcomed 1,21 million foreign visitors, as well as 8,8 million internal tourist stays. The most visited place is the costal city of eThekwini, which is well-known as former Durban, the third city of the country. eThekwini is a multi-ethnic metropolitan area that is playing a key-role in the South African economy, in relation to its industrial port activity, its business sector and the seaside tourism branch. Since the last few years, the eThekwini municipality aims at promoting specific segments, which are clearly foresee in a heritage trend. Sites and/or men of importance - and their history - are rehabilitated and staged, in line with a national ideal. In the South African context, this trend goes beyond the mere preservation of physical sites. Both strong economic as well as political issues have to be considered. Our case studies on both the Inanda Heritage Route and the revitalization of the waterfront of eThekwini would illustrate this reality, answering different visitor’s expectations. Between the aim to act as a global city and the local development and reconciliation challenges, the eThekwini municipality tries to find its way.

The paper argues that photo elicitation interview is an appropriate technique to produce a different kind of information by driving informants in a thinking process about their relationship with their everyday landscapes. First of all, methodological insights and practical considerations about using photographs in interviews are presented and discussed. Whereafter, the paper shows, based on concrete examples, how this technique is able to promote more direct and stronger involvement of the informants in the research process and also provide access to a quantitatively and qualitatively different information to that obtained in conventional interviews.

AB  - Biodiversity stakes are getting more and more important in country planning. In France, knowledge about nature is principally founded on a very original data base gathered at the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle (MNHN) and in the state administration of environment: the Natural Interesting Zones about Ecology, Fauna and, Flora in French, Zones Naturelles d’Intérêt Ecologique, Faunistique et Floristique (ZNIEFF). ZNIEFF are covering more than 20% of French surface. It was only a knowledge zoning, at the beginning. It became year after year power and planning zoning. It is nowadays an argument for many territorial politics. Administration and MNHN present the ZNIEFF database as a scientific inventory. Yet, mapping analyse shows considerable disparities of covering between French regions with no relation with ecological local reality. For example, ZNIEFF surface is more important around Paris than in Limousin region where large wild areas still exist. This fact introduces a problem of legitimacy and equity as soon as this data base is shown as the low in democratic country planning process. Here we show that knowledge of nature is not regular on the territory and its scientific (biological) foundations are very thin. As ZNIEFF are the bases of main politics, all the nature conservation and protection system is unstable in this country. Nevertheless, this data base is a very interesting construction from local partnerships; a cognitive production witch could be used in a different way.

AB  - Following land cover changes during winter is one of the main ways to reduce non-point source water pollution in Brittany, in restricting pollutant fluxes towards rivers. The “bare soils/vegetation” ratio monitoring can be carried out daily at a coarse spatial resolution with SPOT VEGETATION (1 km), and also at a higher spatial resolution with SPOT HRVIR (20 m), although with less repetitive and more spatially limited data. Land-cover changes detected at a regional scale with this ratio can be explained by winter vegetation covering changes as well as by the influence of climatic events. Therefore, observed changes have to be validated from a local scale analysis. The aim of this study is to develop a method that allows to assess high or low variations detected at a regional scale from SPOT VEGETATION images with data registered at a higher scale, SPOT HRVIR images in this case. In this study, the link between the images of the two sensors is set up from the development of an Artificial Neural Network method based on a Kohonen Self-Organizing Features Map. The originality of this method lies in the utilization of the temporal dimension to solve such a change of scales.

AB  - Climate is getting more significant in the study of population dynamics. Experts agree on the fact that climate change will likely be one of the main drivers of ecological change in upcoming decades. The goal of this research is to identify the main drivers of Québec boreal bird species distribution, in order to generate models of future spatial distributions under different climate scenarios. For this purpose two multivariate approaches are employed (Redundancy Canonical Analysis – RDA – and variation partitioning). A total of 39 bird species are selected as well as bioclimatic variables, anthropic disturbances, forest cover and elevation. Bioclimatic variables explain 53% of the variation in species distribution, while resource variables, comprising elevation and percentage of wet areas, are responsible of 5% and anthropic variables of 1%. Model results for two species confirm the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of boreal birds will be deeply modified by climate change and that the birds will likely move towards higher latitude or altitude, following the warming intensity.

AB  - Non-academic treatise, essentially based on information in commercial sources. Knowledge industries need ample financing to prosper but ignorance of the ways money is raised and used leads to excessive waste. Macroeconomic factors structure the locational preferences but are unreliable for ranking regions worldwide and even continentally. The underlying data may be unavailable, inaccurate, or culturally biased. Intellectual property rights are a core location factor but governments get interested only when their own industries enter the global marketplace. The multisectoral and many-layered factors become tangible in the competition of American and European pharmaceutical industries.

AB  - In 2003 dramatic forest fires in Var department renewed the French government interest for fire hazards. This resulted in an acceleration of the implementation of forest fire risks prevention plans (PPRIF) in all French Mediterranean regions. In the Pyrénées-Orientales has been established a particularly aggressive policy towards urbanization in woodland. This case reveals complex issues: economic, political, environmental... For people living in woodland-urban interface, the result of PPRIF is an inflation of new technical and financial constraints which are difficult to accept: while public authorities have supported the protection cost against forest fires for about forty years, it is gradually transferred to house owners. This case confirms the conflictuality of risks management in France and the weak consideration of vulnerability in risk assessment.

AB  - Nature and landscapes are in the center of Aimé Césaire's work, which reinvested them with the values of post-colonialist society: the memory of slavery, the revolt against colonialism, real or dreamed Africa, essential nature. We will try to confront Césaire’s images and real landscapes and see that this poetry renown for his difficulty and darkness offers nevertheless a very concrete reading of the landscapes from Martinique. His metaphors throw us in the heart of the landscape, making us listen “crickets patching scrap” or to observe “the big black sabre of the royal poinciana”. Although places are rarely appointed, the attentive reader-wanderer can recognize them. The complexity of the botanical vocabulary has nothing free; the numerous evoked plants constitute an imaginary herbarium, which for every plant condenses in some words a symbolic value and a very precise naturalist observation. “The heliconia is tearing his heart” express the color, the complex organization and the swelling of the flower of the heliconia, associated to the historic wound of the black world. The darkness of the metaphor operates at the same time as tool of knowledge and mnemonic tool. Inviting us to decipher the infinite complexity of a real Nature and its correlations in an imagination anchored in the depths of a violent history, Césaire modifies irreversibly our perception of landscape.

AB  - The French Polmar-Terre contingency plans aim at organizing the action of Governemental services in the event of a major marine pollution affecting the French coasts. Set up by the Departement Prefect, such plans contain a marine pollution sensitivity atlas, i.e. an operational document that states and prioritize the geomorphological, ecological and socio-economical stakes of the departemental coastal zone. This paper  presents an updated version of the Polmar-Terre atlas of the Département de la Manche, that have been ordered to GEOMER by the Basse-Normandie Regional Direction of the Environment and the MIMEL. The method used to produce the atlas, especially regarding the built up of the sensitivity indexes and their mapping, is presented to feed the current discussion about the national standardization of Polmar-Terre atlases. According to the recommendations of the Polmar-Terre Revision Guide of CEDRE, this work is based on the development of an interservices GIS. Its implementation constraints and its current and future stakes are discussed in the frame of the MIMEL’s Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure purposes.

AB  - Since the advent of the Internet, the digital divide has become a popular issue. “Bridging the broadband gap” has been at the locus of many national and local policies throughout the world. In France, like in similar countries, public and private investments, ad hoc regulation, and the implementation of local loop unbundling have brought broadband access to the Internet to nearly the full country, without regard of location. However, since the middle of the 2000s, the emergence of ultra-high broadband services on a fiber optic local loop – FTTH, for fiber to the home – is threatening to generate a dramatic upheaval of the “net economy”, and to create a territorial “digital divide 2.0”. FTTH is a disruptive, technology, and the new gap would be more harmful and much more costly to bridge. After surveying the decline of digital divide 1.0, this paper elaborates on the geographic and public policy dilemma which is carried on by the unavoidable, but spatially uneven development of optic fiber.

AB  - Lima, like other Latin American metropolises, has experienced profound changes in the context of broader transformation processes since the 1990s. Gated residential developments have emerged as one characteristic feature of the new spatial order. The Peruvian capital shows some unique features however. “Typical” gated communities are relatively seldom. Subsequently enclosed neighbourhoods are the dominant type of residential enclave and the main focus of this article. They have now spread across most parts of the metropolitan area and crosscut socio-economic lines. Security-related interventions such as the installation of street gates or the employment of security guards are implemented subsequently. Further characteristics are the high degree of informality and the dominant role of the residents in local place building. This article analyses different aspects of the fortification process in Lima, such as its dimension, factors shaping the spatial outcome, the interaction with other security-providing bodies and the importance of residential organisation. It will be argued that their emergence must be understood in the context of wider transformation processes related to the recession of the 1980s and structural adjustment of the 1990s. The majority of the population is confronted with a wide range of insecurities. These are most directly expressed through a perceived or real increase in crime and anti-social behaviour. The state, on the other hand, seems to be unable to provide sufficient services. In the realm of security provision this is manifested in the proliferation of additional actors. As a consequence of the “protection gap”, the residents of many areas in Lima have reacted by continuously appropriating, controlling and fortifying their neighbourhoods. This exertion of localised spatial control can be interpreted as an attempt to re-establish stable “comfort zones” as opposed to wider urban social divisions.

AB  - The big farms created following the “agricultural development law” (1983) in Algerian Sahara were intended for cereal production, with two objectives: sustain the economic development of the Saharan regions and reduce the Algerian food dependency, especially in cereals. Since then, the public investments were significant to support this new kind of agricultural development in Algerian arid regions, based on Saudi model. Three decades after the publication of the law, the realizations are still limited. And the farmers, due to the difficult environmental and economic conditions, were constrained to adapt their production towards market gardening under greenhouses alimented by pivots and towards breeding to ensure the durability of their exploitations.

AB  - French agriculture is subject to criticism because of its impact on natural resources, the changes it brings to the countryside, and the sometimes disputed quality of its productions. Faced with the expectations of society and the pressure of regulations, some farmers have decided to organize themselves in networks to propose alternative systems of production. A true dynamic is at work among these minority farmers who are seeking to disseminate their experiences by creating new bonds within the farming population. All claim a greater sustainability in the modes of production, but the degree of challenge to the conventional systems varies according to their conceptions of their trade and their place in society. In this paper, we analyze four alternative networks by examining the recommendations they put forward, the types of production in question, the territorial base of the networks, and the links they establish with the society around them. The experiences reported by farmers in the west of France will enable us to grasp the extent of their activities and the interest to be found in these practices, but also the difficulties they encounter.

AB  - Following the rediscovery of Alfred Marshall’s academic publications during the eighties, a widening number of research papers - mainly draft in Europe and United-States - concentrates on explaining the ins and outs of the spatial and relational proximities. The unsettled notion of cluster popularized from 1990 by Michael Porter had a coronation within the academic community, instead of the substantial conceptual limits underline by various schools of thought. Consequently, the concept of innovation cluster blows in the communications of the spatial economists achieving scientific works on high-tech sector. Unlike the classical approach, innovative clusters assert at least three new features: the regional scale, the collaborative process of governance and then the non-immediately-marketable aspect of the relationships undertook within the cluster. If the innovation cluster’s outlines are still the subject of a large number of theoretical debates, its spatial relevance dashes within the public policies framework – and thus, at every scales from continental one to metropolitan one passing by the national and regional extents, whatever the country’s or Region’s development stage is. If the innovative clusters political experiences lead to mixed results, they however demonstrate a stronger resilience of territories confronted with economic restructuring during a period of manifested crisis.

AB  - This paper aims at showing how the estimations of individual shopping travel behavior depends upon the city. To this end, we use nested multinomial logit models with random coefficients, and apply them to shopping trips in four different Belgian cities (Aalst, Antwerpen, Mechelen and Gent). Results highly depend upon the studied city: spatial behavior is influenced by the size and morphology of the city. These results are quite important when starting a data collection step, which is often expensive and time consuming. Large samples are necessary, and one needs to be careful when generalizing from only one case study. Space matters.

AB  - After pointing out the difficulty of assessment of the risks linked with the transport of dangerous goods (TDG), a method of vulnerability assessment is proposed. This method is based on some mathematical techniques allowing to take into account subjective judgements of experts in order to formalise complex problems : multicriteria decision help methods and fuzzy logic. The practical application of this method requires the use of a geographical information system. A tool destined to prepare interventions is then proposed and the simulation of an accident allows the efficiency of vulnerability maps to be tested.

AB  - Maps, powerful images which render visible and simple numerous and complex data, have a natural vocation to be used as a medium for discussion on area planning and development actions, and as such to be a priviledged tool for democracy. Several experiences in local bodies in France as well as in development institutions in India have demonstrated that the use of maps and visual matrices as an aid for decision is considered dangerous most of the time. Efficient, they reveal spatial unbalances, power stakes and of course corruption. We present some of these experiences which have a stake in democracy and its transparency so much talked about but so little practiced.

AB  - This contribution provides an animated mapping for representing  the concepts of spatial diffusion as applied to  a demographic variable : rare patronymics. The patronymics are used as marker of migration. Initially, the elementary rules of the diffusion are expressed on a map in a theoretical way as  regular and hierarchic networking processes. Then they are projected on the French space of départements taken in its distances, its limits and its hierarchies. Combination of the elementary rules, constrained by the spatial and temporal expression of the migration of the patronymics, leads to a model that is then compared with the observation. The cartographic representation of one scenario of combinations  allows the visualization of the assumptions and the experimentation on the space. In this context the animated map allows the transition from illustration to experimentation.

AB  - According to different approaches in social sciences, the notions of water and territories change when one shifts from « resource » water to «network» water. This bi-polar approach has been overcome by a new environmental model. After a resource « naturalistic » approach « the hydraulic territory », studies on water follow two different lines : one looks specially at the territories scale  shaping (the water shed) while the other stresses the inequalities of water distribution (social geography modelling). In contrast, in relation to territories, the network approach encompasses water as a public utility. It focuses on administrative and concession territories, as well as on technical matters – connected/non connected areas. Then in between, a different model of analysis appears based on environmental sciences and sustainable development. This approach is based upon the cycle of water. The urban territory is gradually replaced by an integrated system including man and nature.

AB  - This paper investigates emerging logics in the production of environmental knowledge in Southern Brazil through the case study of a complex process launched in 2004 that led the state of Rio Grande do Sul to adopt a management tool known as “Environmental Zoning for Silvicultural Activity” (ZAS). In order to regulate the implantation of Eucalyptus, Pine, and Acacia tree-farms on its territory, the State Environmental Administration decided to regulate silvicultural activities by establishing a set of restrictions based on the ecological vulnerability of landscape units. A conflict between public administration, silvicultural companies, and environmentalist groups, led to a thorough reformulation of this zoning plan between 2007 and 2010. The companies succeeded in reducing the restrictions placed on their activity, however, environmentalist groups later successfully imposed the need to conserve biodiversity, most notably natural grasslands. The ZAS is innovative on a regional scale because it is the first attempt to regulate agrarian activities that underpin the advancement of the agricultural frontier over the natural grasslands of the Campos. It also represents the first legal definition of the physiognomy of this herbaceous vegetation, allowing conservation measures to be taken. We explore in this paper some salient aspects of this case study, representative of the current processes of environmental knowledge production in the neo-developmentist context of South America: The contribution of natural resource conflicts in the emergence and legitimation of new environmental categories; The greater capacity of multinational companies to reshape the legislation about environment management; The intensive use of free-access environmental geographical databases (public open data) during the zoning conflict, and the general consensus about the legitimacy of their use. We highlight how this use creates new ways of measuring environmental vulnerability and allows actors to implement new environmental strategies. In spite of being generally conceived as a factor of democratization of information and empowerment, environmental open data may reinforce asymmetries between actors in environmental controversies and the processes of knowledge production.
